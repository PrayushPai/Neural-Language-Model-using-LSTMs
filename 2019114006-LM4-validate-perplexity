 Damp also .	646.2858223162075
 He looked around the room and then called out Come here , quick ?	510.5248866090805
 What is it ?	91.70897088172657
 Barbara asked , standing in the doorway .	160.74376848076864
 I 've solved the mystery of the little bag .	338.47879586248774
 There it is h and there is what was in it .	122.46920817852249
 But where do people go swimming in Paris ?	1130.4626311876204
 That boat in the river , maybe .	273.67587524067636
 What boat ?	1194.523169303938
 There 's a big boat anchored near the Place de la Concorde , with a swimming pool in it- did n't you notice it ?	870.7030675689388
 But if he has time to go swimming , he had time to be with us .	151.43397141204474
 She looked at him in surprise .	210.17735269936495
 I know , he said , reading her mind .	162.5124270296737
 I do n't know what I 'm going to do with you .	289.6453286114923
 It 's because we are in France , he said , and know so few people .	206.843412540901
 So something like this matters more than it would at home .	437.029499104188
 Also , he was so nice when he was nice .	247.46675382209145
 All because I did n't feel like dancing .	547.6999102831994
 I do n't think it was that , really .	199.28185060219485
 Then what was it ?	135.51200906404418
 I do n't know .	151.72530295778043
 I wish I did .	358.5370841986145
 The tweed coat , maybe .	151.1911662040505
 The thing about Eugene is that he 's very proud .	320.07100381337926
 And the thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing suit pointed out , is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be .	490.45388160395214
 For instance- what about all those people Harold Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly , as if this were the one moment they would ever have together , their one chance of knowing each other ?	584.4302643022539
 Fortunately , the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered , or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields .	417.81821467394184
 And in any case , answers may clarify but they do not change anything .	498.65103732953
 h he brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes , of about a hundred pounds ' weight .	243.01451618893876
 They took Jesus 's body , then , and wrapped it in winding-clothes with the spices ; that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial .	320.58899320907364
 Listed as present at the Descent were Mary , Mary 's sister , Mary Magdalene , John , Joseph of Arimathea , Nicodemus .	144.7051428505396
 Search as he might , he could find no place where the Bible spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus .	322.53288251334226
 Mostly the scene was crowded with mourners , such as the dramatic Dell'Arca Lamentation in Bologna , where the grief-stricken spectators had usurped Mary 's last poignant moment .	122.99535220890013
 In his concept there could be no one else present .	369.32674692136413
 His first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe .	291.1479081681323
 When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap ?	789.8212439306526
 Perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground , while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate 's asking for Christ 's body , Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes , and the others had gone home to mourn .	173.75229607971082
 Those who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses .	162.99436261836553
 They would feel what Mary was undergoing .	607.4669659740617
 There would be no halos , no angels .	99.14806471746894
 These would be two human beings , whom God had chosen .	508.3164827511905
 He felt close to Mary , having spent so long concentrating on the beginning of her journey .	428.67035360771246
 Now she was intensely alive , anguished ; her son was dead .	446.25330611037833
 Even though he would later be resurrected , he was at this moment dead indeed , the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross .	312.59247379903536
 In his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt for his mother ; only what Mary felt for her son .	503.1273623285638
 Jesus ' inert body would be passive , his eyes closed .	469.81788484747824
 Mary would have to carry the human communication .	521.2110242582158
 This seemed right to him .	165.09077862862208
 It was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems .	207.49836445108375
 Since his Christ was to be life size , how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming ungainly ?	512.7137248550383
 His Mary would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion , yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child .	239.86331008565003
 There was only one way to accomplish this by design , by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept .	345.4812566633688
 He started by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper .	527.9365692831002
 Visually , these approximated what he was feeling within himself .	131.76322948411988
 At the same time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping at the stalls , storing up fresh impressions of what they looked like , how they moved .	257.3382264161965
 In particular he sought the gentle , sweet-faced nuns , with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads , remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper .	245.68993486302838
 Discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a study of the anatomy of folds .	138.305344273469
 He improvised as he went along , completing a life-size clay figure , then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber , to the consistency of thick mud .	233.72266812631415
 No fold could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the Madonna 's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive support to Christ 's body , to intensify her inner turmoil .	237.9467456028364
 When the cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made .	169.70655295076446
 So that 's sculpture , commented Argiento wryly , when he had sluiced down the floor for a week , making mud pies .	312.90886562831986
 Michelangelo grinned .	275.5847567227674
 See , Argiento , if you control the way these folds are bunched , like this , or made to flow , you can enrich the body attitudes .	245.2964640722952
 They can have as much tactile appeal as flesh and bone .	468.956517766867
 He went into the Jewish quarter , wanting to draw Hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how Christ might have looked .	504.32130253521643
 The Jewish section was in Trastevere , near the Tiber at the church of San Francesco a Ripa .	77.69138329528481
 The colony had been small until the Spanish Inquisition of 1492 drove many Jews into Rome .	398.49176554516475
 Here , for the most part , they were well treated , as a reminder of the Old Testament heritage of Christianity ; many of their gifted members were prominent in the Vatican as physicians , musicians , bankers .	406.76089129226364
 The men did not object to his sketching them while they went about their work , but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to pose .	254.23918459893892
 He was told to ask for Rabbi Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon .	248.11105612853203
 Michelangelo found the rabbi in the room of study , a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey eyes , robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head .	176.2071557519974
 He was reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his congregation .	86.92060594024211
 When Michelangelo explained why he had come , Rabbi Melzi replied gravely The Bible forbids us to bow down to or to make graven images .	590.8526390690762
 That is why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture .	494.78948534934545
 But , Rabbi Melzi , you do n't object to others creating works of art ?	612.9933930821703
 Not at all .	161.52362863861472
 Each religion has its own tenets .	191.79745359196755
 I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble .	221.60771491914275
 I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew .	1150.8516976262165
 I can not accomplish this if you will not help me .	377.9807258858466
 The rabbi said thoughtfully , I would not want my people to get in trouble with the Church .	247.34602804836766
 I am working for the Cardinal of San Dionigi .	248.17812156984212
 I 'm sure he would approve .	512.5081830833889
 What kind of models would you prefer ?	1155.0770171655618
 Workmen .	22.89093458366746
 In their mid-thirties .	33.176983864672366
 Not bulky laborers , but sinewy men .	449.03377396468414
 With intelligence .	332.18800675456674
 And sensitivity .	220.29638546135996
 Rabbi Melzi smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes .	785.1571180233408
 Leave me your address .	306.1870496820266
 I will send you the best the quarter has to offer .	542.0824744157144
 Michelangelo hurried to Sangallo 's solitary bachelor room with his sketches , asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated Madonna .	298.58051596318745
 Sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle couch .	189.9646941209244
 Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber .	2225.2482755379683
 Together he and Argiento built the stand , covering it with blankets .	387.5356168238798
 His first model arrived at dusk .	244.62977352263712
 He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to disrobe , so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins , led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes .	136.96663636994228
 He then draped him over the rough stand , explained that he was supposed to be recently dead , and was being held on his mother 's lap .	322.86527450952906
 The model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; only the instructions from his rabbi kept him from bolting .	366.12231670221024
 But at the end of the sitting , when Michelangelo showed him the quick , free drawings , with the mother roughed in , holding her son , the model grasped what Michelangelo was after , and promised to speak to his friends h. He worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi .	277.2659879318667
 Mary presented quite a different problem .	734.0410787836656
 Though this sculpture must take place thirty-three years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive of her as a woman in her mid-fifties , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry .	364.07414179896386
 His image of the Virgin had always been that of a young woman , even as had his memory of his mother .	169.53366522861276
 Jacopo Galli introduced him into several Roman homes .	332.21762956873334
 Here he sketched , sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk , young girls not yet twenty , some about to be married , some married a year or two .	337.1378072560473
 Since the Santo Spirito hospital had taken only men , he had had no experience in the study of female anatomy ; but he had sketched the women of Tuscany in their fields and homes .	149.18859399630244
 He was able to discern the body lines of the Roman women under their robes .	120.87300087028427
 He spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together a Mary who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; and a Jesus who , though lean , was strong even in death h a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of Santo Spirito .	524.3985069140773
 He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketches .	995.9772217442745
 Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay .	416.4968319522228
 Here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to distort forms .	311.1499841105358
 When he wanted to emphasize , or get greater intensity , he added or subtracted clay .	332.87241037345063
 Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence .	401.1321340233479
 He respected each of these approach techniques , and kept them in character his quill drawings had a scratchiness , suggesting skin texture ; the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an abdomen , in a reclining torso ; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull .	574.7171774142878
 Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; they remained rough starting points .	869.0222925029238
 When carving he was charged with spontaneous energy ; too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model .	482.5599908219877
 The true surge had to be inside the marble itself .	493.811338432097
 Drawing and models were his thinking .	216.08643110112823
 Carving was action .	47.97320247200587
 10 .	877.469878051973
 The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice .	390.47197067560245
 Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal .	387.04747383313565
 Argiento , this is senseless , he complained , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather .	229.9973551661132
 You 're too clean .	983.9971637403352
 Scrub the studio once a week .	297.5903699346803
 That 's enough .	141.45067657336512
 No , said Argiento stolidly .	65.3819295670788
 Every day .	393.07657923162077
 Before dawn .	1230.0255575126014
 I was taught .	136.59515860282843
 And God help anyone who tries to unteach you !	813.1098377993807
 grumbled Michelangelo ; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble about , for Argiento made few demands on him .	236.67360228931142
 The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome .	442.29073757588947
 On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses .	285.73724366672116
 The one thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by announcing Today I go see the horses .	442.7570074374997
 It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him .	198.41754816849615
 He was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim , when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil .	212.2958536159063
 He stumbled into the house , eyes burning like fire .	457.8367440704147
 Argiento made him lie down on the bed , brought a pan of hot water , dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter .	313.07260551882916
 Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned .	211.10640909443808
 He assumed he could blink the splinter out .	52.24035278741338
 But it would not come .	84.64138023810006
 Argiento never left his side , keeping the water boiled , applying hot compresses throughout the night .	439.70606711414945
 By the second day Michelangelo began to worry ; and by the second night he was in a state of panic he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye .	266.730832290889
 At dawn Argiento went to Jacopo Galli .	109.69492252548426
 Galli arrived with his family surgeon , Maestro Lippi .	171.1456019980258
 The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons .	148.98917019297627
 He told Argiento to take a bird out of the cage , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood gush into Michelangelo 's injured eye .	292.4080316378916
 The surgeon came back at dusk , cut the vein of a second pigeon , again washed out the eye .	118.61406321110437
 Beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps .	152.20165544440079
 The thin legs twitched convulsively once , then Kate felt the little body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound .	409.76200441787523
 The scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands .	1932.7879929772632
 The child was gone .	119.02294993061946
 When Juanita awoke , Kate was still rocking the dead child , still crooning in disbelief , No , no , oh , no !	443.83474410850414
 They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian minister .	765.1685714485247
 He sat beside Kate 's bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God 's will , while Kate lay staring angrily at him .	755.5499236524566
 When he told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words rebelliously .	342.141571790395
 Few of the neighbors came , but Mrs Tussle came , called by tragedy .	264.1093109153289
 It always comes in threes , she sighed heavily .	357.94352249414356
 Trouble never comes but in threes .	127.22424726936879
 They held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot .	574.9985642949168
 Kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment .	288.5519804996514
 She would not accept the death of such a little child .	182.8415112213504
 God called her to Him , the minister had said .	424.1873066390495
 God would not do that , Kate thought stubbornly .	396.74511494377595
 Jonathan 's letter came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child 's death as another judgment from God against both Kate and himself .	423.26523676950495
 In blind panic of grief she accepted Jonathan 's dictum , and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by God .	401.7112864999318
 She held Jonathan 's letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed .	271.217999704514
 She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son .	243.37227192436833
 Joel came and sat mutely with her , sharing her pain and anguish , averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom .	285.40662539115374
 Juanita and Mrs Tussle kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried .	1062.192634642141
 When she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty .	629.718114205172
 She disciplined herself daily to do what must be done .	688.48008671594
 She had even steeled herself to keep Juanita upstairs in the nurse 's room off the empty nursery , although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance of the baby 's death .	468.80070399509043
 Juanita drooped about the place , wearing a haunted , brooding look , which Kate attributed to the baby 's death , until the day a letter came for her addressed to Miss Juanita Fitzroy , bearing a Grafton postmark .	232.56553573131637
 Seeing the slanting hand , Kate knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel .	344.32560099711515
 The Federal forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving to take all the mountains .	182.93718171546908
 Kate tried to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended , at what involvement existed for Juanita .	397.1829240902321
 Uncle Randolph and Joel had replanted the bottom lands with difficulty , for more of the slaves , including Annie , had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp .	194.20041133569185
 Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school .	294.5053982855535
 He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry .	241.7534491578918
 Kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss .	506.0530994871029
 She loved him and missed his company .	383.6619683275882
 Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own .	555.4610360497679
 What it was Kate could not fathom .	197.3932085057803
 He claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his cronies , but Kate had not smelled brandy on him since Mrs Lattimer 's funeral .	350.74398805638015
 Joel knew what he was about , however .	111.40288766630026
 You 're gon na get caught , she heard Joel say to Uncle Randolph by the pump one morning .	374.9245658826076
 Not this old fox , chuckled Uncle Randolph .	445.55922514061166
 Everybody knows I 'm just a harmless , deaf old man who takes to drink .	1040.6983872973794
 I aim to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure .	322.1201644215594
 Whisky still , my foot , said Joel .	125.21158597911084
 You 're back there riding with the guerrillas , the Moccasin Rangers .	84.93969533266643
 Hush , said Uncle Randolph , smiling , or I 'll give you another black eye .	454.6368142373285
 He patted the eye Joel had had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads some days back .	221.70221212230808
 Kate had no idea what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night , had heard horsemen on the River Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn .	676.7347686054013
 Stranger , Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle , drunkenly singing Old Dan Tucker at the top of his voice .	297.37620255385747
 Hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road , Kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house , cold sober .	379.343570836801
 What he was about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by General McClellan , threatening reprisals against Rebel guerrillas .	226.01115549379728
 She was taken up in worry for the reckless old man .	395.18766585137683
 Kate drew more and more on her affection for Joel through the hot days of summer work .	606.1629491223824
 She had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer , after she saw Miss Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom .	232.8754190352145
 Kate had walked past the school on her morning chores and had seen the whole incident , had seen Joel 's burning humiliation before Miss Snow 's cold , bespectacled wrath .	705.6368164639978
 He had the hardest pains of growing before him now , as he approached twelve .	354.42799493409564
 These would be his hardest years , she knew , and he missed his father desperately .	335.6702008707435
 She tried to find some way to draw him out , to help him .	204.9253718208761
 Whenever she found time , she went blackberry picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths purple , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day .	547.5216446896984
 He tended the new colts Beau had sired .	155.89659304542317
 He helped Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower garden in the side yard , where they sometimes sat in the still evenings watching the last fat bees working against the summer 's purple dusk .	838.5646190453566
 No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph .	490.1287642171722
 They stayed in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the peddler , bringing the news .	228.1585321654516
 Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it ; of their first engagement at Falling Waters after Old Jack 's First Brigade had destroyed all the rolling stock of the BO Railroad .	632.0519846115612
 The men were restive , he wrote , ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished .	191.46014406067212
 The peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in Wheeling , Which had formed a new state government by declaring the government at Richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors .	266.23057080999166
 Dangling his gaudy trinkets before them , he told of the Rebel losses in the mountains , at Cheat and Rich mountains both , and the Federal march on Beverly .	126.78381859702087
 Cleaned all them Rebs out'n the hills , they did !	351.27514192313726
 They wo n't never git over inter loyal western Virginia , them traitors !	595.1650448613625
 The Federals is making everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too , he crowed .	186.43846006449934
 After he had gone , Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly , Would you take their oath ?	894.6516988783526
 And the old man had given a sly and wicked laugh and said , Hell , yes !	224.7600176019487
 I think I 've taken it about fifty times already !	1182.9493105060078
 winking at Joel 's look of shock .	122.29022468918988
 Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate 's baby and at Jonathan 's decision to go with the South And , dear Kate , she wrote , poor Dr Breckenridge 's son Robert is now organizing a militia company to go South , to his good father 's sorrow .	875.1448172231295
 Maj Anderson of Fort Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the US Army .	315.59816560475196
 In spite of the fact that the state legislature voted us neutral , John Hunt Morgan is openly flying the Confederate flag over his woolen factory !	812.4235100754053
 Rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley .	217.69595137460942
 Accounts were garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg for the news .	228.75921339034352
 All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas Junction and it were a big fight , the old man told them .	147.6986649518809
 In the next few days they had cause to rejoice .	146.8366755102263
 It had been a big battle , and the Confederate forces had won .	230.9930661872093
 Jonathan and Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing .	160.0478448879486
 Kate and Mrs Tussle waited for letters anxiously .	814.297476369869
 Joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate .	227.49987825120286
 When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful .	839.3935029174921
 They all prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come , for Virginia had defended her land victoriously .	473.9088064230995
 The week after Manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon 's rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window .	673.0033219109263
 They had already lost most of their corn , she thought .	365.515051304428
 Were they to be insulted again because of the South 's great victory ?	176.23653873612182
 She remembered McClellan 's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs .	615.5387180064845
 At the landing she saw Juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door .	373.4441006400545
 Juanita stopped just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth .	379.18531671962285
 As Kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel Marsh framed in the doorway , his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita wore .	558.3715641239489
 Kate greeted him gravely , uneasy with misgivings at his visit .	883.0681923824422
 What brings you here again , Colonel Marsh ?	515.9660520108602
 she asked , taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun .	406.01674679567566
 I stopped to say goodbye , Mrs Lattimer , and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby .	305.70685280179043
 I wish our doctor could have saved her .	1044.39526277015
 It was a terrible loss to me , said Kate quietly , feeling the pain twist again at the mention , knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at Grafton .	365.0207356061296
 Where will you go now that you 're leaving Parkersburg ?	593.8054008206709
 she asked him , seeing Juanita 's eyes grow bleak .	1079.293595887269
 As you know , General McClellan has been occupying Beverly .	1600.8389432093506
 He has notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the Potomac .	113.26127808151837
 I am to go to Washington to serve with him .	172.91258151644018
 When are you to leave ?	337.41191277083095
 Kate asked , watching them both now anxiously .	731.9923158699744
 Their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions , she thought sadly .	924.9589605431141
 Tomorrow .	22.338677578551994
 Would you permit Juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell , Mrs Lattimer ?	355.0859826732981
 Stay here in the parlor where it 's cool , she said , trying to be calm .	206.15581613657147
 It would be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and Mrs Tussle not to see them .	135.70265938407437
 Kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations .	1250.9472402282636
 Then she took iced lemonade to Marsh 's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden .	319.15448210226106
 When Marsh called to his aide and the pair rode off down the River Road where the gentians burned blue , Juanita was shaken and trying not to cry .	498.6524112561914
 She sought Kate out upstairs , her lips trembling .	2537.083814376525
 He wants me to go with him tomorrow , she told Kate .	575.152891462519
 What do you want to do ?	327.7852196969845
 Kate asked , uneasy at the gravity of the girl 's dilemma .	472.3280883403456
 I could go with him .	101.9396544889879
 He knows me as your niece , which , of course , I am .	268.0631312691577
 But I am a slave !	368.48563613171075
 You own me .	538.710958747639
 It 's your decision , said Juanita , holding her face very still , trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly .	421.1940681907625
 No , the decision is yours .	240.94462328803283
 I have held your papers of manumission since I married Mr Lattimer .	325.6066411904664
 The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky .	133.27742776522655
 The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no more .	410.54428330427186
 The things left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows .	208.47513456836484
 Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and then empty of images .	233.88657515815382
 They slept- Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring , the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table .	120.66336773947084
 In the ballroom below , the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows .	322.83146717322705
 It was a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky .	213.61952107483543
 Martha Schuyler , old , slow , careful of foot , came down the great staircase , dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk , her jeweled shoe buckles held forward .	369.80259811357513
 Well , I 'm here at last , she said , addressing the old portraits on the walls .	363.1942042174187
 I do n't hear the music .	196.02651981640807
 I am getting deaf , I must admit it .	689.8274909159818
 She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that led down to it .	176.91120493543073
 Where is everyone ?	647.4569701971166
 I say , where is everyone ?	361.81703083674057
 Peter , you lummox , you 've forgot to order the musicians .	399.0424815921669
 She stood there , a large old woman , smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning , this big foolish baby of a son .	304.5626017295669
 There were times now , like this , when she lost control of the time count and moved freely back and forth into three generations .	478.01635113252723
 Was it a birthday ball ?	1495.3204289534835
 When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen ?	885.9285815550871
 Or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big house , a Van Rensselaer bride from way upstate near Albany , from Rensselaerwyck .	362.8067301776507
 And this handsome booby , staring and sweating , was he her bridegroom ?	115.00522347259147
 Martha picked up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom .	365.23904825961466
 David Cortlandt was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh .	433.5825771593634
 He had ridden hard from Boston , and he was not used to horseback .	70.32898884574928
 Now , driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler , he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move .	464.61169063173304
 The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather than the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood memories .	378.72466623945724
 He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held on as the sulky 's wheels hit a pothole and came out with a jolt and went on .	142.0554499246835
 He would cross to Manhattan , to Harlem Heights , before morning .	675.4464912207935
 There a certain farmhouse was a station for the Sons of Liberty .	188.03529415046938
 He would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news .	454.22651465848224
 And he would sleep , sleep , and never think of roads and horses ' sore haunches , of colonial wars .	484.3230623365509
 Strange how everything here fitted back into his life , even if he had been away so long .	308.5237140593926
 Mynheer , Sir Francis , the valley society , the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched road .	265.68313394789266
 A mist was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a blending and merging grace .	169.648558257345
 Ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads .	314.2896874854581
 David reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags at his feet .	117.86247241501856
 He pulled out one of them and cocked it .	114.3624426929354
 A strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes .	1015.9742799417
 It was a grotesque hen , five or six feet tall .	774.158730099962
 It had the features of a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers .	127.39092329398967
 It ran , this apocalyptic beast , on two thin legs , and its wings- were they feathered arms ? - flapped as it ran .	193.45563868295926
 Its groin was bloody .	35.627220118670316
 Black strips of skin hung from it .	1417.6152461030706
 The horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its nostrils .	95.55100656872479
 David took a firm hand with it .	473.52326030520766
 The creature in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes , glazed with an insane fear .	631.3376401026895
 The ungainly bird thing ran away , and to David its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster .	112.17366505088064
 Then it was gone .	112.48849794107201
 He drove on , wary and shaken .	204.68088345282095
 The Sons were out tonight .	675.7961150290522
 CHAPTER 10 New York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island .	424.61261339678964
 It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets , mostly around the Battery , going bravely north to Wall Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights .	489.7220702331513
 From there it looked across at Westchester County and the Hudson River where the manor houses , estates , and big farms of the original non-Indian landowners began .	187.465881207772
 On the east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long Island Sound .	759.398479379309
 On the western tip of Long Island protruded Brooklyn Heights .	1275.356958921196
 It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor .	622.8581346934458
 A fringe of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights , and behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields .	558.6579131705367
 Husbandry was bounded by snake-rail fences , and there were grazing cattle .	187.5243141216412
 On the shores north and south , the fishers and mooncursers- smugglers- lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand , Fire Island .	398.6819582167163
 The morning hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay , sheltered by the Jersey inlets .	190.78293164709467
 They often threw tidbits overboard .	669.1305966209512
 The larger ships were near Paulus Hook , already being called , by a few , Jersey City .	303.2019454773174
 These were the ships of His Majesty 's Navy , herding the hulks of the East Indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the loyalists .	82.40180681661933
 The news of battle on Breed 's Hill had already seeped through , and New York itself was now left in the hands of the local Provincial Congress .	205.93199359177947
 The fish hawk , his wings not moving , circled and glided lower .	169.0066353367973
 The gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him , the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black , the bronze cannon at the ports .	306.2195056603273
 The captain 's gig of HMS Mercury was being rowed to HMS Neptune .	39.56485701503748
 On shore the freed slaves to despotism- the town dwellers- watched the ships and waited .	503.55846124814394
 The chevaux de frise , those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the Battery , pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in .	228.08831251868995
 Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber ; their rock paths led down to the Hudson .	875.6846306265347
 Below in the open bay facing Manhattan was Staten Island , gritty with clam shells and mud flats behind which nested farms , cattle barns , and berry thickets .	429.26849160563023
 Along Wappinger Creek in Dutchess County , past the white church at Fishkill , past Verplanck 's Point on the east bank of the Hudson , to the white salt-crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen .	354.4432026225495
 Today , tomorrow , six months , even perhaps a year h The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight .	616.355502940612
 The British ships rolled at anchor , sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London .	1739.1615783553984
 Waited for more ships , more lobster-backed infantry , and asked what was to be done with a war of rebellion ?	241.47048998982808
 David Cortlandt , having slept away a day and a night , came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem River near Spuyten Duyvil .	225.29716524255954
 He looked out through windowpanes turned a faint violet by sun and weather , looked out at King 's Bridge toward Westchester .	358.276158462179
 The road seemed animated with a few more wagons than usual ; a carriage raising up the choking June dust , and beyond , in a meadow , a local militia company drilling with muskets , Kentuck ' rifles , every kind of horse pistol , old sword , or cutlass .	432.40167010802605
 The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded David 's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston .	420.1000595186972
 Pensive , introspective , he ached .	14.881547312550303
 He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept .	179.07793428388032
 Now there was more to do .	140.84796921610857
 Orders not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government .	284.96125023226097
 He scratched his mosquito-plagued neck .	62.55668837132291
 From the saddlebags , hung on a Hitchcock chair , David took out a good English razor , a present from John Hunter .	252.61209888876732
 He found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap , and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt , its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost h. He hoped he was free of self-deception .	190.24477300432017
 Here he was , suddenly caught up in the delirium of a war , in the spite and calumny of Whigs and Tories .	138.61691617997866
 There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war .	337.38957354719395
 David Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface .	217.74144848319762
 He knew that many were using it for their own ends .	219.5193185639152
 But it did not matter .	125.44661531990943
 He stropped the razor slowly ; what mattered was that a new concept of Americans was being born .	136.77407659992974
 That some men did not want it he could understand .	320.27339517823776
 The moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers .	319.0946941451449
 Yet some , like Morris Manderscheid , would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas .	183.2912593051653
 Unique circumstances would test us all , he decided .	340.8904059416337
 Injury and ingratitude would occur .	58.34715852876784
 No doubt John Hancock would do well now ; war was a smugglers ' heaven .	365.17696128046776
 And what of that poor tarred and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from Schuyler 's ?	180.1168927068471
 Things like that would increase rather than be done away with .	809.8445360771696
 One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing .	202.22817699516725
 He saw with John Hunter now that the perfectability of man was a dream .	166.59340216742189
 Life was a short play of tenebrous shadows .	298.95580918954835
 David began to shave with great sweeping strokes .	1035.2912819440032
 Time plays an essential part in our mortality , and suddenly for no reason he could imagine or admit the image of Peg laughing filled his mind- so desirable , so lusty , so full of nuances of pleasure and joy .	607.4781701864272
 He drove sensual patterns off , carefully shaving his long upper lip .	585.4555790847032
 It is harder , he muttered , to meditate on man or woman than on God .	236.44415013529172
 David finished shaving , washed his face clean of lather , and combed and retied his hair .	194.3753605216758
 He was proud that he had never worn a wig .	130.31075270034464
 More and more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder .	293.51997973786456
 He felt cheerful again , refreshed ; presentable in his wide-cut brown suit , the well-made riding boots .	229.38190743953965
 It is so easy to falsify sentiment h. In the meadow below , militia officers shouted at their men and on King 's Bridge two boys sat fishing .	974.471569659042
 The future would happen ; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much .	400.67487467444306
 A man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days .	595.9133204291559
 He began to pack the saddlebags .	96.8088589051684
 And all this too shall pass away it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy- yes , in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal Hudson Valley , where a feeling of plenitude was normal in those English-Dutch manors with their well-fed squires .	262.95069861422087
 Burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on in a primitive way , almost unchanged from feudal times .	502.9536943089717
 Peasants puzzled Andrei .	128.9463791013184
 He wondered how they could go on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish .	590.6877056989582
 Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long ago .	363.783091127391
 Tolek Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine and , before the national leadership , exalted the miracles of drying up swamps and irrigating the desert .	143.66741656077667
 A fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched .	652.6635373129194
 Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference .	227.4812906767293
 Had he found the meaning too late ?	786.0249981903601
 It aggravated him .	25.73991152119539
 The land of the Lublin Uplands was rich , but no one seemed to care .	96.38704439161141
 In the unfertile land in Palestine humans broke their backs pushing will power to the brink .	320.54433544114124
 He had sat beside Alexander Brandel at the rostrum of a congress of Zionists .	60.02142360579807
 All of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified ideologies , and each berated the other and beat his breast for his own approaches .	321.64195648970025
 When Alexander Brandel rose to speak , the hall became silent .	391.5909135296197
 I do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism .	445.3003137311351
 We are here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest , seeking human dignity .	1484.2473208629162
 Beyond the forest all our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren , eroded hills of Judea .	393.8669013514614
 This is our singular goal .	396.01783796753955
 How we travel through the forest is for each man 's conscience .	397.6154398991315
 Where we end our journey is always the same .	607.2325428381421
 We all seek the same thing through different ways- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over Zion .	556.9629990389433
 This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism .	401.2485769092971
 It had sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it .	126.94774931698522
 In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine .	128.53312254587382
 He loathed the idea of drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright .	88.49284665130092
 Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex , I only want to be a Pole .	129.06194264390606
 Warsaw is my city , not Tel Aviv .	50.92504185165604
 And now Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief .	186.0769146149531
 Warsaw !	65.81827352770962
 He saw the smug eyes of the Home Army chief , Roman , and all the Romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him .	298.33391703650966
 They had let this black hole of death in Warsaw 's heart exist without a cry of protest .	467.5248045373023
 Once there had been big glittering rooms where Ulanys bowed and kissed the ladies ' hands as they flirted from behind their fans .	415.7114443459722
 Warsaw !	65.66835922225256
 Warsaw !	67.0499079289275
 Miss Rak .	181.87313124236556
 I am a Jew .	193.88966632399286
 Day by day , week by week , month by month , the betrayal gnawed at Andrei 's heart .	352.3378355789485
 He ground his teeth together .	390.9066562655402
 I hate Warsaw , he said to himself .	94.16600859780367
 I hate Poland and all the goddamned mothers ' sons of them .	465.4264497785654
 All of Poland is a coffin .	125.55312939458658
 The terrible vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind .	715.8499234095661
 What matters now ?	609.5646450458177
 What is beyond this fog ?	651.2860328830859
 Only Palestine , and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe .	165.2319090274381
 By late afternoon the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at Lublin , which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the Russian front .	199.99167623317302
 At a siding , another train which was a familiar sight these days .	636.656731685669
 Deportees .	22.150755707168226
 Jews .	1148.9735368271167
 Andrei 's skilled eye sized them up .	215.6369659640383
 They were not Poles .	45.41255081198544
 He guessed by their appearance that they were Rumanians .	72.47020051517251
 He walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka .	87.96921972336557
 Of all the places in Poland , Andrei hated Lublin the most .	268.4112825683656
 The Bathyrans were all gone .	93.09195520523514
 Few of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto .	296.4008811643859
 From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point .	167.3861373361583
 He and Ana watched it carefully .	148.09319597950486
 Lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere .	144.43009409155388
 Early in 1939 , Odilo Globocnik , the Gauleiter of Vienna , established SS headquarters for all of Poland .	354.98285093486396
 The Bathyrans ran a check on Globocnik and had only to conclude that he was in a tug of war with Hans Frank and the civilian administrators .	219.4671601421508
 Globocnik built the Death's-Head Corps .	104.05889273998083
 Lublin was the seed of action for the final solution of the Jewish problem .	123.3616605751948
 As the messages from Himmler , Heydrich , and Eichmann came in through Alfred Funk , Lublin 's fountainhead spouted .	99.26210701666913
 A bevy of interlacing lagers , work camps , concentration camps erupted in the area .	224.94581450731883
 Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners of war disappeared into Lublin 's web .	476.78961996250746
 Plans went in and out of Lublin , indicating German confusion .	567.787132289527
 A tale of a massive reservation in the Uplands to hold several million Jews h A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to the island of Madagascar h Stories of the depravity of the guards at Globocnik 's camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention of their names .	317.5691918524294
 Lipowa 7 , Sobibor , Chelmno , Poltawa , Belzec , Krzywy-Rog , Budzyn , Krasnik .	17.710993797994483
 Ice baths , electric shocks , lashings , wild dogs , testicle crushers .	68.04148459824926
 The Death's-Head Corps took in Ukrainian and Baltic Auxiliaries , and the Einsatzkommandos waded knee-deep in blood and turned into drunken , dope-ridden maniacs .	44.98237829367218
 Lublin was their heart .	63.09579156409157
 In the spring of 1942 Operation Reinhard began in Lublin .	199.89679827813507
 The ghetto , a miniature of Warsaw 's , was emptied into the camp in the Majdan-Tartarski suburb called Majdanek .	203.69240829232976
 As the camp emptied , it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around Lublin , then by deportees from outside Poland .	156.3973475921782
 In and in and in they poured through the gates of Majdanek , but they never left , and Majdanek was not growing any larger .	181.72521922385997
 What was happening in Majdanek ?	149.04167914253347
 Was Operation Reinhard the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw ?	372.1367059086606
 Was there another Majdanek in the Warsaw area , as they suspected ?	184.78939385035642
 Andrei stopped at Litowski Place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings .	445.37183549523934
 His watch told him he was still early .	424.13243101358324
 Down the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall .	247.87398311573455
 He found an empty bench , opened a newspaper , and stretched his legs before him .	502.2189564085841
 Krakow Boulevard was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their Auxiliaries .	270.93639185453833
 Captain Androfski !	781.5945442773836
 Andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the mustached , homely face of Sergeant Styka .	122.05225954811334
 Styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly .	122.95526579321488
 I have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn .	523.9316900807929
 I thought you might get in on a morning train .	393.02621371946356
 It 's good to see you again , Styka .	94.05571344035064
 Styka studied his captain .	285.553961313723
 He almost broke into tears .	616.0757149130321
 To him , Andrei Androfski had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer .	167.91235509986674
 His captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby .	323.8924682527195
 Remember to call me Jan , Andrei said .	547.7710230815572
 Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously .	79.8544098388622
 When that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy since before the war .	541.3854284383152
 I 'm lucky that you were still living in Lublin .	318.5868504463349
 Styka grumbled about fate .	120.9715253401681
 For a time I thought of trying to reach the Free Polish Forces , but one thing led to another .	529.3392207114797
 I got a girl in trouble and we had to get married .	320.05904705646014
 Not a bad girl .	334.4894105267325
 So we have three children and responsibilities .	448.46144160674504
 I work at the granary .	39.41637205688567
 Nothing like the old days in the army , but I get by .	203.25260135761357
 Who complains ?	283.557925403851
 Many times I tried to reach you , but I never knew how .	393.9521668021525
 I came to Warsaw twice , but there was that damned ghetto wall h I understand .	275.6186716940087
 Styka blew his nose again .	107.90074115605222
 Were you able to make the arrangements ?	204.66425832080694
 Andrei asked .	76.81793697362573
 There is a man named Grabski who is the foreman in charge of the bricklayers at Majdanek .	110.95881775323747
 I did exactly as instructed .	440.940180498095
 I told him you are on orders from the Home Army to get inside Majdanek so you can make a report to the government in exile in London .	277.01816096962517
 His answer ?	377.9434950027622
 Ten thousand zlotys .	527.3482171426045
 Can he be trusted ?	1384.5462309945053
 He is aware he will not live for twenty-four hours if he betrays you .	332.35467815178686
 Good man , Styka .	85.15408968018427
 Captain h Jan h must you go inside Majdanek ?	2090.1422682357547
 The stories h Everyone really knows what is happening there .	1484.331537845995
 Not everyone , Styka .	123.71231101328424
 What good will it really do ?	603.626596953946
 I do n't know .	153.29990477603562
 Perhaps h perhaps h there is a shred of conscience left in the human race .	267.97214421680445
 Perhaps if they know the story there will be a massive cry of indignation .	290.2944158012144
 Do you really believe that , Jan ?	989.3048512223913
 I have to believe it .	116.60346577462727
 Styka shook his head slowly .	372.9052297180518
 I am only a simple soldier .	324.0296726823227
 I can not think things out too well .	330.63636038961107
 Until I was transferred into the Seventh Ulanys I was like every other Pole in my feeling about Jews .	344.5983244333405
 I hated you when I first came in .	538.9169581845538
 But h my captain might have been a Jew , but he was n't a Jew .	238.62434054165442
 What I mean is , he was a Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys .	71.87459855594157
 Hell , sir .	129.62091670783127
 The men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name .	619.196135559397
 You never knew about it , but by God , we taught them respect for Captain Androfski .	359.6602199751968
 Andrei smiled .	160.1144840890646
 Since the war I have seen the way the Germans have behaved and I think , Holy Mother , we have behaved like this for hundreds of years .	643.1605963025017
 Why ?	448.7557840967641
 How can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see ?	587.11504667683
 But we are neither blind nor insane .	2567.691685549303
 The men of your company would not allow your name dishonored .	263.69377168741454
 Why do we let the Germans do this ?	642.8121064944647
 I have sat many hours with this , Styka .	197.65690332449515
 All I ever wanted was to be a free man in my own country .	232.41903729350807
 I 've lost faith , Styka .	299.2701912314402
 I used to love this country and believe that someday we 'd win our battle for equality .	615.1048072754112
 But now I think I hate it very much .	450.35945248165626
 And do you really think that the world outside Poland will care any more than we do ?	727.8982084852493
 The question frightened Andrei .	220.21164167829028
 Please do n't go inside Majdanek .	191.2361154368185
 I 'm still a soldier in a very small way , Styka .	162.0560698045774
 It was an answer that Styka understood .	114.58452569543553
 Grabski 's shanty was beyond the bridge over the River Bystrzyca near the rail center .	209.0713920966326
 Grabski sat in a sweat-saturated undershirt , cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown .	188.93538877677597
 He was a square brick of a man with a moon-round face and sunken Polish features .	173.37266869492214
 Flies swarmed around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread .	198.95994431084495
 Half of it dripped down his chin .	284.17604137359933
 He washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch .	156.7027103231109
 Well ?	572.4571899248009
 Andrei demanded .	155.16509810954184
 Grabski looked at the pair of them .	69.95259752180384
 He grunted a sort of yes answer .	157.41560901780244
 My cousin works at the Labor Bureau .	1134.69594293063
 He can make you work papers .	407.29228625644316
 It will take a few days .	138.31654865193633
 I will get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew .	502.28533837705146
 I do n't know if I can get you into the inner camp .	302.294032437477
 Maybe yes , maybe no , but you can observe everything from the roof of a barrack we are building .	476.1866129407251
 Grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup bowl .	98.56399430139966
 Ca n't understand why the hell anyone wants to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place .	532.1702638185807
 Orders from the Home Army .	200.42024799495016
 Why ?	453.2802729238351
 Nothing there but Jews .	586.4618602397459
 Andrei shrugged .	14.38447065497652
 We get strange orders .	1102.9829851833829
 Well- what about the money ?	149.14042153055152
 Andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty notes .	163.84954551476005
 Grabski had never seen so much money .	254.28642502686637
 His broad flat fingers , petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying , snatched the bills clumsily .	329.9793610682879
 This ai n't enough .	525.2041426424834
 You get the rest when I 'm safely out of Majdanek .	350.53810892469744
 I ai n't taking no goddamned chances for no Jew business .	715.9787016474525
 Andrei and Styka were silent .	63.48608972341975
 She was getting real dramatic .	1044.0536193373432
 I 'd have been more impressed if I had n't remembered that she 'd played Hedda Gabler in her highschool dramatics course .	343.31606584181026
 I did n't want her back on that broken record .	460.7997602713642
 Nothing 's free in the whole goddam world , was all I could think of to say .	182.44350676771373
 When I 'd delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink .	449.7750864505659
 I am , she said .	163.70742004542475
 I 'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky Derby and how it was Thelma 's fifty dollars I was spending .	321.98732017869713
 It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days , and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch .	443.7625969271359
 Drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me .	258.5780153509488
 I was crazy about her all over again .	307.56206231248575
 It was the call of the wild all right .	124.28171211850189
 That evening turned out to be hell like all the others .	305.3209378166538
 We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill .	183.31735444032708
 It was the same old routine .	100.9933492623339
 Eileen got to dancing , just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed tune that you could hardly notice , and trying to pick up strange men , but each time I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she 'd pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet husky voice about the good times and the happiness we 'd had together and there I was back on the hook .	448.88052267769
 I did have the decency to call up Thelma and tell her I 'd met old friends and would be home late .	547.5138452775992
 I could scratch her eyes out , Eileen cried and stamped her foot when I came back from the phone booth .	418.53062016067645
 You know I do n't like my men to have other women .	378.4932240874895
 I hate it .	196.18383541683008
 I hate it .	196.89872573523377
 She got so drunk I had to take her home .	433.73879075888556
 It was a walk up on Hudson Street .	253.5731979559879
 She just about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and would n't let me go .	761.2884943231287
 There was a man 's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table .	217.3942340133591
 The place smelt of some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use .	280.72721205872745
 What about Ballestre ?	108.91905338400588
 I had to shake her to make her listen .	360.0722088384334
 Precious .	22.451125049687363
 What about him ?	168.96710185970534
 Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic .	1044.426433796624
 Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom .	494.2807596039018
 We are above being jealous .	179.51185864163799
 He 's used to me bringing home strange men .	786.9514562347653
 I 'll just tell him you 're my husband .	688.9976201956979
 He ca n't object to that .	248.36558857053245
 Well I object .	661.8203990021483
 If he pokes his nose in here I 'll slug him .	435.96394033161954
 That really would be funny .	348.13999852056185
 She began to laugh .	393.823565185439
 She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed .	754.8221553827267
 After all I 'm made of flesh and blood .	492.3028381375752
 I 'm not a plaster saint .	702.6937852392683
 Waking up was horrible .	196.98110199459973
 Never in my life have I felt so remorseful about anything I 've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife .	570.7708042595741
 We both had hangovers .	72.77934004427064
 Eileen declared she could n't lift her head from the pillow .	271.17500033202066
 She lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot .	372.922152530671
 I was stumbling in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when I smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell .	243.7402781973652
 There was somebody else in the apartment .	194.2376429430702
 I stiffened .	26.86174570782051
 Honest I could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a dog 's that is going to get into a fight .	289.42867126009605
 I turned around with the percolator in my hand .	105.69996321935879
 My eyes were so bleary I could barely see him but there he was , a little smooth olivefaced guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora .	222.9957682613675
 Brown eyes , eyebrow mustache .	108.16958425222532
 Oval face without an expression in the world .	161.2760127238538
 We did n't have time to speak before Eileen 's voice was screeching at us from the bed .	165.62698044652498
 Joseph Maria Ballestre meet Francis Xavier Bowman .	866.9705045596813
 Exboyfriend meet exhusband .	91.16137124144186
 She gave the nastiest laugh I ever heard .	442.8275050334386
 And do n't either of you forget that I 'm not any man 's property .	394.4512042160267
 If you want to fight , go down on the sidewalk .	193.482043089526
 She was enjoying the situation .	169.37104357196097
 Imagine that .	48.691545417782876
 Eileen was a psychologist all right .	215.39743382753952
 Instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard I found myself having a fellowfeeling for him .	391.35258321939386
 Maybe he felt the same way .	140.8373686713698
 I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life .	110.97500721166153
 First thing I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and I was handing Eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers .	264.7846218320133
 I could n't face Thelma after that night .	255.33645080921758
 I did n't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone .	263.74577647796247
 I wrote her that I 'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express .	692.1324142261993
 Of course I had to give her Eileen 's address , but she never came near us .	299.24734877863796
 All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever .	530.8091806166743
 She never said a word about the fifty dollars .	406.1239071889789
 She added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking .	545.7602230682946
 I must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times .	367.8567713175518
 Afterwards I learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband away .	215.81229695911313
 That finished me with Thelma .	152.9287753033771
 Trust Eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation .	146.1748615442132
 And there I was shacked up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street .	391.53882695535856
 I use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship .	679.2852117184882
 I felt it and it ate on me all the time , but I did n't know how right I was till later .	317.36114438222535
 What I did know was that Precious was always around .	139.37139053992237
 He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs .	173.65631989807417
 Who do you think pays the rent ?	1796.6948795816456
 You would n't have me throw the poor boy out on the street , Eileen said when I needled her about it .	236.3635617118713
 I said sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention .	448.0015138470343
 Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening to things she did n't want to hear .	283.976132698733
 Still I did n't think she was twotiming me with Precious right then .	314.4387147318083
 To be on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night .	481.6166541542673
 Precious had me worried .	214.54320414924854
 I could n't make out what his racket was .	156.26066455077986
 I 'd thought him a pimp or procurer but he did n't seem to be .	130.5594989337487
 He was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his selfeffacing manner .	381.53371795067346
 Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet .	192.11016930011633
 Whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious who did the work .	367.25485030210695
 I never could find out what his business was .	307.43267930376
 He always seemed to have money in his pocket .	219.0413540535106
 The phone had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger .	258.8133439371205
 Now and then he would disappear for several days .	333.151853749433
 Connections was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions .	694.2844869146778
 Oh he 's just an international spy , Eileen would shout with her screechy laugh .	327.282186419716
 Poor devil he ca n't have been too happy either .	1950.69271938024
 He got no relief from drink because , though sometimes Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening , he 'd leave it on the table untouched .	402.32824835065935
 When I was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess .	957.536759441837
 Occasionally if I pushed him too far he 'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his .	1131.824678661253
 Some day , I told Eileen , that guy will kill us both .	435.43059157971527
 She just would n't listen .	394.99014879759704
 Getting drunk every night was the only way I could handle the situation .	412.21757714398973
 Eileen seemed to feel the same way .	105.86534722602923
 We still had that much in common .	188.82952103768372
 The trouble was drinking cost money .	739.7328852636253
 The way Eileen and I were hitting it up , we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening .	514.154710694832
 Eileen must have wheedled a little out of Precious .	65.66523890272803
 I raised some kale by hocking the good clothes I had left over from my respectable uptown life , but when that was gone I did n't have a cent .	310.1308213019195
 I do n't know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer had n't come to town .	344.98020050161034
 Pat O'Dwyer looked like a heavier Jim .	656.8072271060847
 He had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he did n't have Jim 's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm .	304.66458262591027
 He was a big thick beefy violent man .	310.5535480677505
 Now Pat may have been a lecher and a plugugly , but he was a good churchgoing Catholic and he loved his little sister .	173.88779434265354
 Those O'Dwyers had that Irish clannishness that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything .	409.73485553667354
 Pat took Eileen and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again .	339.2846547512658
 Whom God hath joined etcetera .	920.9325939328498
 The O'Dwyers were real religious people except for Kate .	661.8384194737349
 Now it would be up to me to keep the little girl out of mischief .	228.60660864081655
 Pat had been worried as hell ever since she 'd lost her job on that fashion magazine .	1824.7570101071049
 It had gone big with the Hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of Art and Apparel .	357.53069350800473
 How about me trying to help her get her job back ?	748.7219776990087
 All evening Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion .	495.709076522941
 It just about blew us both out of the water when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with .	269.7117715632218
 But brother I ca n't take a job right now , she said with her eyes on her ice cream , I 'm going to have a baby , Francis Xavier 's baby , my own husband 's baby .	542.6453014055722
 My first thought was how had it happened so soon , but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we 'd been living together six weeks .	714.7310321987036
 Pat meanwhile was bubbling over with sentiment .	857.8454869419531
 Greatest thing that ever happened .	233.9823749468588
 Now Eileen really would have to settle down to love honor and obey , and she 'd have to quit drinking .	633.9058212126582
 He 'd come East for the christening , by God he would .	215.98504813040375
 When we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into Eileen 's hand to help towards a layette .	768.0024288377194
 Before he left town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job .	384.53997204573557
 Pat had contacts all over the labor movement .	800.1990835821473
 A friend of Pat 's named Frank Sposato had just muscled into the Portwatchers ' Union .	311.76380240791246
 The portwatchers were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves .	84.47440153392986
 Most of them were elderly men .	468.01155622948636
 It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of New York .	303.3884369771162
 They were n't as well paid as they should have been .	277.44399703616335
 One reason the portwatchers let Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen .	152.93810722587398
 Sposato needed a front , some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the Redhook local .	501.6251028806764
 There I was a retired wobbly and structural iron worker who 'd never gouged a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement .	505.5314537256305
 For once radicalism was a recommendation .	116.33076340899711
 Sposato could n't wait to get me hired .	388.0244792167059
 With my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked the honest working stiff .	715.6862936240349
 The things a man will do for a woman .	214.39467204636472
 There was one fact which Rector could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny .	184.96067411548248
 As long as there were two human beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave .	438.99712527039793
 No matter how devoted a man was , no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord , he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual .	415.2420993964399
 All of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord 's servants .	160.82146012871826
 It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions .	205.11927372969933
 Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church- his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel .	211.05734934208238
 He was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego , demanding to be satisfied , for the two were intertwined and could not be separated .	190.49055276325237
 He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated , the Communists in the village rooted out , the mission standing triumphant , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant , too .	243.0238473956601
 But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan , that man 's ambition when linked with God would be a driving , indefatigable force for good in the world .	244.76360947576524
 He sighed .	237.07112163763696
 How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice .	260.6975367647189
 He would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought about , would be sweet indeed .	387.92471317557346
 His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days .	224.4178263331903
 His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print shop , using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse .	252.960212125293
 In any event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked , telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what Kayabashi was planning .	292.918928533634
 Hino was elated at the prospect .	35.07960690317047
 He was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor- an excellent place to make contact with the enemy .	235.00096175497862
 He left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday , nodding attentively as Rector gave him his final instructions .	160.54688029917023
 He was to get involved in no arguments ; he was to try to make no converts ; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard .	231.66450257196456
 It was a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it , for Hino , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage agent .	266.4048287316644
 If he wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection .	229.8321482315477
 In all of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino .	271.09616252871007
 From the moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job , any job- his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise hand- he had been ready to become a Christian .	269.319733263358
 He had already been studying the Bible ; he knew the fundamentals , and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector , announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that .	227.43245617093214
 Rector had never been able to find out much about Hino 's past .	176.70414827434487
 Hino talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject .	421.5664628695072
 Putting the pieces of this mosaic together , Rector had the vague outlines of a biography .	72.97286690914181
 Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in Chiba , and divided his life between the land and the sea , supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat .	329.33578287692524
 Without exception Hino 's brothers turned to either one or both of their father 's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller .	562.3609381188564
 He had gone into the Japanese navy , had been trained as an officer , had participated in one or two battles- he never went into detail regarding his military experience- and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out of the blue , he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian .	277.5702657794104
 Rector was often curious ; often tempted to ask questions but he never did .	613.9650096751558
 If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so unasked .	131.40375271213532
 Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellished with his active imagnation .	140.75699816767278
 When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village , Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return , for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector 's office rarely rang unless it was important .	155.34064518822544
 He was surprised to find Kayabashi 's secretary on the other end of the line .	103.86007829166917
 He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted .	122.2541863790388
 The oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries , the secretary said , businessmen from Tokyo for the most part , and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission .	169.3381552174218
 They had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it .	272.10043476750536
 Oh ?	780.2763668920006
 Rector said .	38.77173260583218
 I guess it will be all right .	273.5743536173841
 When would the oyabun like to bring his guests up here ?	260.6242723161098
 This afternoon , the secretary said .	236.64299614226337
 At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time .	360.72172647175177
 All right , Rector said .	88.35379872618068
 I will be expecting them .	206.88637767756708
 He was about to hang up the phone , but a note of hesitancy in the secretary 's voice left the conversation open .	217.28385518736943
 He had something more to say .	112.44831598097201
 I beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers , he said .	433.1454778539434
 Rector laughed despite himself .	548.7300342308928
 Unless the oyabun has been working on it , he said , then checked himself and added You can tell Kayabashi-san that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use .	311.8681560965242
 Arigato gosaimasu .	14.305182352434485
 The secretary sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in Rector 's hand .	249.4007502043907
 Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission .	230.3628882940415
 For the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it was probably the latter .	272.97965567865316
 Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village .	245.40183949325237
 At the same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity .	367.48898099763966
 No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived .	207.08695018151062
 When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds .	316.7926464601594
 Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn .	149.1469163610727
 Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .	173.78271742898755
 A good initial impression would be important now .	513.1097424171849
 He went into the print shop , where Fletcher had just finished cleaning the press .	341.4976108193694
 How many pamphlets do we have in stock ?	946.6588067083798
 Rector said .	38.20507363990856
 I should say about a hundred thousand , Fletcher said .	194.27370956930446
 Why ?	448.75462846950853
 I would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon , Rector said , He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create , the picture of a very busy mission .	292.6638415469865
 He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly , just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner .	290.8845810275564
 Fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things Rector requested .	383.6556259881344
 Rector 's next stop was at the schoolroom , where Mavis was monitoring a test .	138.11541667191193
 He beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside .	299.8492367128391
 He told her of the visitors and then of his plans .	172.20970411497098
 How many children do you have present today ?	944.307922937457
 he said .	130.89825806450514
 She looked back toward the schoolroom .	103.46161084451582
 Fifteen , she said .	279.67371291041314
 No , only fourteen .	494.4299932585448
 The little Ito girl had to go home .	194.05787605591203
 She has a pretty bad cold .	612.4729062924737
 I would like them to appear very busy today , not busy exactly , but joyous , exuberant , full of life .	338.0879823376661
 I want to create the impression of a compound full of children .	284.9789373686212
 Do you think you can manage it ?	919.1739909668878
 Mavis smiled .	159.9082424794312
 I 'll try .	340.44848163553337
 As Rector was walking back toward the residential hall , Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him .	287.5893504855484
 The altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen his spirits , but he was still a little wary around Rector for they had not yet discussed the incident .	175.90523383073307
 I think I 've fixed the pump so we wo n't have to worry about it for a long time , he said .	395.84950494497826
 I 've adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water gets too low .	941.6700582180775
 Fine , Rector said .	142.8279285113207
 He looked out over the expanse of the compound .	58.00747594531479
 It was going to take a lot of activity to fill it .	134.77833211436644
 Have you ever operated a transit ?	2149.62598897712
 he said .	130.43755859665242
 No , sir , Johnson said .	419.9714461816671
 You are about to become a first-class surveyor , Rector said .	136.451976526953
 When Konishi gets back with the jeep , I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys .	332.3950617952364
 Konishi can help you .	197.39483199445365
 You 'll find an old transit in the basement .	388.12933171048445
 The glass is out of it , but that wo n't matter .	210.81359748625536
 It looks pretty efficient and that 's the important thing .	459.1728059491496
 He went on to explain what he had in mind .	187.6568112071847
 Johnson nodded .	4773.966017930712
 He said he could do it .	76.5616233146256
 Rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall .	269.619289854854
 It was rather a childish game , all in all , but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much .	296.6471739925364
 He was not sure what effect it would have , but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it .	269.7164718285004
 He was not going to lose the mission by default , and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission , he was going to be in for a surprise .	158.28469051702803
 He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall , and then to take charge of the office while the party was here .	301.51115200163656
 When everything had been done , Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock .	425.15148665954973
 At two thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi 's party .	190.7974995135087
 Then Rector , attired in his best blue serge suit , sat in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoking a cigarette and waiting .	163.8906030976054
 The air was cooler here , and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass , an effect which he found pleasant .	231.5861743996831
 She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient .	537.6366976124878
 The fish took the bait .	113.35701279168444
 He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but- joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned .	342.05889980944386
 But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement .	218.6824632697968
 She was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed .	237.62367569396767
 Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose .	337.03166891303016
 She wrote again and now , abandoning for the moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career .	248.870118307572
 She could act and she could write .	369.38619605888925
 His lordship was concerned in the management of Drury Lane but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and criticize her novel ?	211.1904800571041
 At last he consented to meet her , and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal Have you any objection to the following plan ?	802.6636040619186
 On Thursday evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles .	690.1394537744027
 There we shall be free and unknown ; we can return the following morning h She concluded by asking for a brief interview- to settle with you where- and she threw in a tribute to his gentle manners and the wild originality of your countenance .	467.28971323442363
 She opened his reply with trembling fingers h he agreed !	1497.012290194043
 And he would see her that evening .	222.86087315417154
 Victory at last !	2859.822104036948
 At their meeting he told her not to bother about where- he would attend to that .	386.6565322644326
 There was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and , as Claire rose to go , he asked her to sing him one song before she left .	175.63798006382362
 She sang him Scott 's charming ballad Rosabelle , which was the vogue of the moment .	218.9439711533146
 She had never sung better .	734.8156679749799
 Your voice is delightful , he approved with a warm smile .	796.1649343204743
 Tomorrow will be a new experience- I have never before made love to a nightingale h. There have been cooing doves , chattering magpies , thieving jackdaws , a proud peacock , a silly goose , and a harpy eagle- whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals .	180.51027821773698
 And so they went , he choosing of all places an inn near Medmenham Abbey , scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the Hellfire Club .	222.98183107237344
 He regaled Claire with an account of the mock mass performed by the cassocked bloods , which he had had at firsthand from old Bud Dodington , one of the leaders of the so-called Order .	140.7497695546726
 Each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this , it seems , was not employed for self-flagellation h. Naked girls danced in the chancel of the Abbey , the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities .	302.1539758834106
 The jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish .	77.45469215739719
 Alas , all that belonged to the age of Devil Dashwood and Wicked Wilkes , abbot and beadsman of the Order !	51.220340272485544
 The casual seduction of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison .	79.96097485819193
 They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate .	159.03853688331193
 A scant half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace , the air about them scented with stock , and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden .	299.4502529037853
 Charming and peaceful- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure ?	449.9420398522572
 Alone with the fabulous Byron !	625.8463619569065
 How many women had longed for the privilege that was hers .	266.9993091879809
 How was she to behave , Claire wondered .	206.4981650213191
 To be passive , to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd .	288.2534477450862
 She was the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare 's poem .	244.0535138297443
 And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience , satiety might well be an equal handicap .	258.430163165335
 No , she would not pretend modesty , but neither must she be crudely bold .	237.1409451719085
 Mystery- that was the thing .	56.56306514007214
 In the bedroom she would insist on darkness .	564.83963622756
 With his club foot he might well be grateful .	711.9680471872408
 At the inn , which was situated close to a broad weir , Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference and addressed as milord .	113.56017437896385
 The place was evidently a familiar haunt and Claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown .	348.62070812852465
 The fire in the sitting room was lighted .	318.32884639532256
 What about the bedroom ?	257.85716119075846
 Byron inquired .	9317.720071988782
 Seems to me last time I was here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell .	394.265315349217
 We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney , milord , but I promise you you 'll never have trouble of that sort again .	351.94797113237195
 So , not only had he been here before , but it seemed he might well come again .	223.6848716966347
 Claire felt suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan .	239.66232093101104
 A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port .	547.5171006344043
 When Napoleon 's ship had borne him to Elba , French wines had started to cross the Channel , the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years , but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled .	445.560163593258
 As they waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in hand , while Byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers .	379.53958186499733
 Sex is overpriced , he said .	24.677660571404804
 The great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against Fate , not man against man for the prize of a woman 's body .	298.93763321822644
 So do n't see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance .	536.4732322867189
 The gods seemed to think sex pretty important , she rebutted .	453.2433162511962
 Mars and Venus , Bacchus and Ariadne , Jupiter and Io , Byron and the nymph of the owl 's nest .	110.62839614709988
 That would be Minerva , I suppose .	68.6742937545232
 Was n't the owl her symbol ?	477.0012327417807
 Byron laughed .	4511.678440039
 So you know something of the classics , do you ?	325.39642122236694
 Tell me about Minerva , how she behaved , what she did to please you .	296.1731312899256
 I 'll tell you nothing .	362.6339248031128
 I do n't ask you who 't is you 're being unfaithful to , husband or lover .	385.61192549553317
 Frankly , I do n't care .	96.79781933288598
 For a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity , who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind .	421.55399378112867
 Very well , she said , I 'll not catechize you .	170.59886395725985
 What matter the others so long as I have my place in history .	411.9260425959425
 She was striking the right note .	357.5962621289323
 No man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed , with one so favored , flattery could hardly seem overdone .	283.5633180511565
 Brains and beauty , high position in both the social and intellectual worlds , athlete , fabled lover- if ever the world was any man 's oyster it was his .	256.59363632773653
 The light supper over , Claire went to him and , slipping an arm about his shoulder , sat on his knee .	252.66321243214085
 He drew her close and , hand on cheek , turned her face to his .	485.1236673507763
 Her lips , moist and parted , spoke his name .	443.9094512573534
 Byron !	13528.344612147168
 His hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown ; then , to better purpose , he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers , untied it .	162.41988015682819
 The bodice beneath was buttoned and , withdrawing his lips from hers , he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it , unhurriedly as if she were a child .	118.41017613172683
 But , kindled by his kiss , his caressing hand , her desire was aflame .	50.17037418864751
 She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom .	509.69570146042344
 Lord Byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color .	1455.6855418339007
 He drank slowly with due appreciation .	341.57538592705276
 It was an excellent vintage .	53.65835210371163
 He rose and went to the bedroom .	130.0586762098025
 Pausing in the doorway he said The form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , is the most challenging loveliness in all nature .	192.49032315934087
 When Claire returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become Byron 's mistress .	320.765699255109
 By odd coincidence , on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read Parisina , which was the latest of the titled poet 's successes .	405.5472717110697
 As he declaimed the sonorous measures , it was as much as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings .	216.304146180185
 Although it is not the best of which he is capable , said Shelley as he closed the book , it is still poetry of a high order .	213.2367839028713
 If he would only leave the East , said Mary .	278.09457105303557
 I am tired of sultans and scimitars .	91.95592382039108
 The hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte , said Claire , with slightly overdone carelessness .	143.57189652385344
 How do you know that ?	312.20974021806103
 demanded Mary .	2244.5882358132844
 I was told it on good authority , Claire answered darkly .	166.78411712090193
 I must n't tell , I must n't tell , she repeated to herself .	366.2215332627319
 I promised him I would n't .	322.4900478375952
 CHAPTER 9 WINTER CAME , and with it Mary 's baby- a boy as she had wished .	283.5715717479636
 William , he was called , in honor of the man who was at once Shelley 's pensioner and his most bitter detractor .	208.26553362359002
 With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter Fanny and Mrs Godwin will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement , and that her child is well .	508.30562402094733
 At the same time another child- this one of Shelley 's brain- was given to the world Alastor , a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind 's musings .	146.16032525576935
 Alastor was published only to be savagely attacked , contemptuously ignored .	144.55965012419392
 Shelley sent a copy to Southey , a former friend , and another to Godwin .	199.889427998844
 Neither acknowledged the gift .	1085.8088214293282
 Only Mary 's praise sustained him in his disappointment .	724.91634365672
 She understood completely .	972.9156278255713
 Not a thought nor a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation .	421.3507689690227
 You have made the labor worth while , he said to her , smiling .	299.88325654399966
 And in the future , since I write for a public of one , I can save the poor publishers from wasting their money .	220.60978319456524
 A public of one , Mary echoed reprovingly .	88.55451813741678
 how can you say such a thing ?	885.7921262745206
 There will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of Alastor .	59.919363805506514
 There are some even now .	163.6515470881694
 What about that dear , clever Mr Thynne ?	542.078896418954
 I am sure he is in raptures .	126.69998221446959
 Poor Mr Thynne , he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement .	200.50468110742113
 There are other Mr Thynnes .	127.24552771646391
 Not everyone is bewitched by Byron 's caliphs and harem beauties .	134.56858798282096
 Mary 's supercritical attitude toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute .	337.1820925368426
 She was resentful of his easy success as compared with Shelley 's failure .	318.7946805399002
 The same month that Alastor was published , Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The Siege of Corinth , a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley 's generosity rebelled at .	334.8299312426404
 The lordly poet was at low-water mark .	104.88088730888637
 The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent .	1028.6616551125012
 On all sides doors were being slammed in his face .	322.4309555297762
 The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity .	197.09657269089274
 Now , under the impact of his wife 's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be .	156.86785264375493
 He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin .	455.74550047447366
 For the moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity .	172.34999039227563
 But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing .	303.39872058642277
 Byron , since the separation from his wife had been living in a smallish house in Piccadilly Terrace .	175.22983504143946
 He refused to bring Claire to it even as an occasional visitor , claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes .	206.9916818589448
 Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel .	191.7542671752636
 He had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order , but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonel 's belt .	284.7108486306269
 Despite his yearning , the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines .	269.7033024540476
 He would remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task .	368.7829526605306
 -Beckworth .	22.344081844117287
 -Sir ?	48.75757736634453
 -Fetch me the copies of everything B and C companies have requisitioned in the last six months .	348.5618397809741
 -The last six months , sir ?	916.6068676629517
 -You heard me .	121.87136138842773
 There 's a lot of waste going on here .	310.5931008942248
 It 's got to stop .	252.80093890775703
 I want to take a look .	164.78549096305733
 This is no damned holiday , Beckworth .	69.59506395209706
 Get busy .	4938.42093697363
 -Yes , sir .	129.71834286378814
 Beckworth left the tent .	154.11565674214287
 Below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank .	205.53041039489733
 He glanced back .	246.41007040015754
 The colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs , methodically tearing at his thumbnail .	159.41821454196804
 9 THE BOMBPROOF was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth .	216.51907982160097
 It stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank .	280.53725901401117
 From the outside , it seemed no more than a low drumlin , a lump on the dark earth .	130.84277375613004
 A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor .	680.9420459549525
 Two slits enabled observers to watch across the river .	594.8485514785424
 The place smelled strongly of rank , fertile earth , rotting wood and urine .	175.07972700274996
 The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson 's boots .	374.7706955570683
 At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle .	453.9301923426715
 There was no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back , stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams .	300.83713922122234
 In the corner was the soldier with the white flag .	172.78857479678103
 He stood stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth .	222.02034051396464
 Watson hardly looked at him .	640.5048652403448
 The man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant , brandishing the flag of truce .	156.3493175642581
 Someone had hauled him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed .	426.29715605210697
 An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank .	258.6615918274209
 The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy .	464.38088385339523
 When the boat had touched , the weaker ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers .	346.28167409644846
 Watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof .	114.83616193775046
 The officer had told him that both lists must be checked .	364.70833874290577
 Watson had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass .	219.94066966869644
 The officer , surprised , said he would have to see .	195.12418262472434
 Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later .	592.2334112288637
 He had peered through the darkness at the rampart .	41.006699912114904
 The men he would take back across the river stood there , but he turned away from them .	229.23091515066108
 He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt .	202.1514779085681
 He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him .	90.59522396339054
 Though Watson carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence .	447.5717726741098
 Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence could not exorcise his form .	176.42613712215885
 Watson glanced briefly at him , seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner .	1141.22079860634
 -We wo n't be too long .	342.8547047396988
 If my pass is approved , I may be a half hour .	344.1727912477012
 The soldier answered in a curious , muffled voice , his lips barely moving .	936.608117722447
 Watson turned away and did not see the man 's knees buckle and his body sag .	214.52084921236622
 -Yes , sir .	130.46983675283428
 He had acknowledged the man .	118.49162877460493
 It was easier to think now , Watson decided .	284.6882095391886
 The stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts .	676.6864560476839
 He paced slowly , stooping , staring at the damp , slippery floor .	114.50651451371111
 He tried to order the words of the three Union officers , seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy .	278.07800103358
 But he groped blindly .	158.3456469718747
 His lack of success steadily eroded his interest .	391.55065039922954
 He stopped pacing , leaned against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift .	189.5375539322056
 A feeling of futility , an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known , seeped through him .	291.4301363992661
 What in the name of God was he doing , crouched in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river ?	198.53041638599097
 Why had he crossed the dark water , to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole ?	209.11791427708968
 He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion .	213.2227524490111
 He was conscious of a growing sense of absurdity .	235.01885894765462
 Hillman had written it all out , had n't he ?	125.4092174293864
 Was n't the report official enough ?	1302.95160616913
 What did he hope to accomplish here ?	331.08249737443833
 Hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank .	270.1136204625172
 Prompted by a guilty urge , he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected .	151.53084227276776
 For what ?	267.63059295583565
 To tell John something he would find out for himself .	351.6615516080569
 The figure in the corner belched loudly , a deep , liquid eruption .	159.64285216242862
 Watson snorted and then laughed aloud .	1239.9370654068555
 Exactly !	65.9035631921518
 The soldier 's voice was muffled again , stricken with chagrin .	167.45532223580364
 He clutched the staff , and his dark eyes blinked apologetically .	186.81786168699446
 -'Scuse me , sir .	201.27932076864917
 -Let 's get out of here .	139.25072288772725
 Watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river weeds .	274.6454578881784
 To his left , the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank .	132.15449917864606
 The flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current .	223.75618634209937
 A soldier held the end of a frayed rope .	191.02757863032846
 Three Union guards appeared , carrying their rifles at ready .	1992.011033313436
 Watson stared at them curiously .	403.13145094935726
 They were stocky men , well fed and clean-shaven , with neat uniforms and sturdy boots .	436.94626259718444
 Behind them shambled a long column of weak , tattered men .	240.78332157703792
 The thin gray figures raised a hoarse , cawing cry like the call of a bird flock .	392.37963330881934
 They moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness , elbowing and shoving .	36.92966889119046
 Four men were knocked down , but did not attempt to rise .	407.09997681444406
 They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats .	234.67537488834364
 The Union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy , indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs .	285.5512435234436
 The crawling men tried to rise and fell again .	201.36649021002282
 No one moved to them .	151.1138913060218
 Watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg shrilly .	699.5016444451671
 In a confused , soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms , the two men were dragged into the same skiff .	143.1830574670714
 The third crawling man forced himself erect .	616.3259987349162
 He swayed like a drunkard , his arms milling in slow circles .	178.8597066776147
 He paced forward unsteadily , leaning too far back , his head tilted oddly .	147.52561838565322
 His steps were short and stiff , and , with his head thrown back , his progress was a supercilious strut .	164.82845420721972
 He appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom .	170.86322959278309
 He stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge , his weight nearly swamping the craft .	123.58764387171777
 Watson looked for the fourth man .	302.42919775024774
 He had reached the three passive guards ; he crept in an incertain manner , patting the ground before him .	179.44551098619363
 The guards did not look at him .	225.67227057298877
 The figure on the earth halted , seemingly bewildered .	289.7498805455864
 He sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound .	202.3940205077833
 Then he began to crawl again .	81.04874662358965
 Watson watched the creeping figure .	1733.274320624169
 He felt a spectator interest .	191.49258486045778
 Would the man make it or not ?	420.27245573984356
 If only there was a clock for him to crawl against .	174.1050122788353
 If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes , say , then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud .	155.6276284572173
 Say three minutes to make it sporting .	1378.8199115744785
 Still the guards did not move , but stood inert , aloof from the slow-scrambling man .	116.29146752946292
 The figure halted , and Watson gasped .	223.0155433973322
 The man began to creep in the wrong direction , deceived by a slight rise in the ground !	345.2700331959316
 He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart .	144.15992739054298
 Watson raced for him , his boots slamming the soft earth .	583.5087850296374
 The guards came to life with astonishing menace .	771.6534963953657
 They spun and flung their rifles up .	355.7438980884538
 Watson gesticulated wildly .	764.3217122527928
 One man dropped to his knee for better aim .	711.1768478815474
 -Let me help him , for the love of God !	174.46498867468978
 The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with sullen , puzzled faces .	655.475530453324
 Watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped , panting heavily .	116.27578032122919
 He reached down and closed his fingers on the man 's upper arm .	277.9532937394986
 Beneath his clutch , a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone .	134.96328299609937
 Watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet .	402.34337379939376
 Watson stared into a cadaverous face .	305.07280150333435
 Two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids .	464.032822494536
 Light sticks of fingers , the tips gummy with dark earth , patted at Watson 's throat .	648.1663151593713
 The man 's voice was a sweet , patient whisper .	168.78737027738413
 -Henry said that he 'd take my arm and get me right there .	377.27619942344114
 But you ai n't Henry .	855.4361743850191
 -No .	22.29149969587734
 -It do n't matter .	164.29339502818453
 Is it far ?	484.047542994534
 How far could it be , Watson thought bleakly , how far can a blind man crawl ?	373.2149033950558
 Another body length or all the rest of his nighted life ?	259.24943759009165
 -Not far .	102.63646693336639
 -You talk deep .	595.5445999181954
 Not like us fellas .	159.72615108200122
 It raises the voice , bein in camp .	163.99304016504138
 You Secesh ?	105.59448389158295
 -Yes .	23.0368499348202
 Come on , now .	453.4139488692138
 Can you walk ?	1848.1578220339438
 -Why , course I can .	223.33335481842008
 I can walk real good .	1040.4934836641348
 Watson stumbled down the bank .	1046.7905768715684
 The man leaned his frail body against Watson 's shoulder .	577.1421471399248
 He was no heavier than a child .	157.14153460772124
 Watson paused for breath .	3278.663211210232
 The man wheezed weakly , his fetid breath beating softly against Watson 's neck .	463.08559443312583
 His sweet whisper came after great effort .	472.85569714311646
 -Oh , Christ h. I wish you was Henry h. He promised to take me .	762.2280548643522
 -Hush .	22.275305716102654
 We 're almost there .	339.0210805456892
 Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff .	170.66340422173633
 The man swayed on a thwart , turning his ruined eyes from side to side .	213.41841686016798
 Watson turned away , sickened for the first time in many months .	163.82096758770973
 He heard the patient voice calling .	425.94519173056847
 -Henry ?	48.8129761411011
 Where are you , Henry ?	462.00991320110273
 -Make him lie down !	350.8788896243348
 Watson snatched a deep breath .	787.850399488731
 He had not meant to shout .	50.145377754529065
 He stood with his back to the skiff .	49.26354658109496
 The men mewed and scratched , begging to be taken away .	99.76661901888912
 Watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches .	149.29030208717901
 -Goddamn you !	132.12960679020154
 What do you do to them ?	240.2201448024649
 Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly .	30.274689886604982
 He was angry , sickened .	44.36261105104909
 He had not felt that during the afternoon .	110.12945382574321
 No , nor later .	405.94383704940714
 All his emotions had been inward , self-conscious .	193.89934827489125
 In war , on a night like this , it was only the outward emotions that mattered , what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others .	199.2150992315043
 Yes .	670.6618428929495
 That was it .	29.610754995373004
 He was sure of it .	63.48503942226011
 John 's type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen .	643.8209471878438
 What a fool he had been to think of his brother !	336.3467404020954
 So Charles was dead .	512.4495581660066
 What did it matter ?	322.3854659699249
 His name had been crossed off a list .	267.527673215764
 Already his cool body lay in the ground .	648.9649629608062
 What words had any meaning ?	441.4117147545504
 What had he thought of , to go to John , grovel and beg understanding ?	240.80904279213652
 To confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu , gouging at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade him rise and go ?	367.68951111445756
 Men were slaughtered every day , tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute .	534.2874349938173
 What made him think John had a right to witness his brother 's humiliation ?	375.28690272546976
 What right had John to any special consideration ?	547.5246654291277
 Was John better , more deserving ?	492.3839870948984
 To hell with John .	570.5972015322421
 Let him chafe with impatience to see Charles , rip open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in Hillman 's beautiful , schoolmaster 's hand .	348.93521230853923
 John would curse .	1283.1657178965506
 He believed that brave boys did n't cry .	919.455466895151
 Watson spat on the ground .	134.46362032759998
 He was grimly satisfied .	58.42204337252364
 He had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother 's pain .	346.1112154377438
 Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering .	338.3393505953986
 I WOULD not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming , O Gogol , O Chekhov , O Thackeray and Dickens , what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris ducks , a birdbath , and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps ?	228.77010813662076
 As I say , I would n't want to begin a day like this , but I often wonder what the dead would have done .	327.81309255240217
 But the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge .	122.86430763049567
 I can see it from this window where I write .	308.3894344293303
 It was built by the Pasterns , and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property .	122.99188408781804
 It bulks under a veil of thin , new grass , like some embarrassing fact of physicalness , and I think Mrs Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning .	232.58700339536838
 It would have been like her .	147.36425402640688
 She was a pale woman .	218.44378366816616
 Sitting on her terrace , sitting in her parlor , sitting anywhere , she ground an axe of self-esteem .	360.02296845320024
 Offer her a cup of tea and she would say , Why , these cups look just like a set I gave to the Salvation Army last year .	685.937009961532
 Show her the new swimming pool and she would say , slapping her ankle , I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes .	482.5042164320528
 Hand her a chair and she would say , Why , it 's a nice imitation of those Queen Anne chairs I inherited from Grandmother Delancy .	737.0882434819638
 These trumps were more touching than they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights were long , her children ungrateful , and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare .	238.44039606624395
 Twenty years ago , she would have been known as a golf widow , and the sum of her manner was perhaps one of bereavement .	303.9873852916507
 She usually wore weeds , and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that Mr Pastern was dead , but Mr Pastern was far from dead .	304.2281873474975
 He was marching up and down the locker room of the Grassy Brae Golf Club shouting , Bomb Cuba !	225.589671666502
 Bomb Berlin !	748.7132448581862
 Let 's throw a little nuclear hardware at them and show them who 's boss .	777.562972857146
 He was brigadier of the club 's locker-room light infantry , and at one time or another declared war on Russia , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , and China .	314.8483825211937
 It all began on an autumn afternoon- and who , after all these centuries , can describe the fineness of an autumn day ?	277.417250770407
 One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it .	206.10719499876632
 The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year 's lights .	252.28904472976356
 Leaves were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled , for all its ammoniac acidity , of beginnings .	145.90937875305076
 The boundless blue air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum .	208.98855560062907
 Leaving her house one late afternoon , Mrs Pastern stopped to admire the October light .	678.2293340947606
 It was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis .	74.71566639148726
 Mrs Pastern had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of receipts .	345.02068419501256
 It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks .	535.9609793777989
 Her house stood on a rise of ground , and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below .	461.93205968118616
 Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity .	521.9117056708893
 Mrs Balcolm worked for the brain .	239.3749537437047
 Mrs Ten Eyke did mental health .	1963.3887102858582
 Mrs Trenchard worked for the blind .	245.92899327177057
 Mrs Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat .	320.4992551369897
 Mrs Trempler was tuberculosis , Mrs Surcliffe was Mothers ' March of Dimes , Mrs Craven was cancer , and Mrs Gilkson did the kidney .	225.22876488737262
 Mrs Hewlitt led the birthcontrol league , Mrs Ryerson was arthritis , and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton 's house , a roof that signified gout .	144.59275607735265
 Mrs Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer .	439.0495751988464
 It was her destiny ; it was her life .	162.50730686897364
 Her mother had done it before her , and even her old grandmother , who had collected money for smallpox and unwed mothers .	503.43522384795693
 Mrs Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance , and most of them were ready for her .	435.7685017269879
 She experienced none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias .	368.3998996493135
 Here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry .	311.0774535833984
 The contributions were ahead of what she had got the previous year , and while the money , of course , was not hers , it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks .	260.2049909194615
 She stopped at the Surcliffes ' after dusk , and had a Scotch-and-soda .	58.64942308621586
 She stayed too late , and when she left , it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband .	493.99386555335275
 I got a hundred and sixty dollars for the hepatitis fund , she said excitedly when he walked in .	276.2767435118358
 I did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans .	117.88013731235047
 I want to get my kit in tomorrow morning- would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner ?	626.2791873085833
 But I do n't know the Flannagans , Charlie Pastern said .	110.62822431240136
 Nobody does , but they gave me ten last year .	1077.3604919500524
 He was tired , he had his business worries , and the sight of his wife arranging pork chops in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day .	175.3550741700544
 He was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the Blevins ' , thinking that they might give him a drink .	256.7930269450426
 But the Blevins were away ; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door .	328.9953978778602
 Turning in at the Flannagans ' driveway , he tried to remember if he had ever met them .	284.6348358249301
 The name encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the Irish .	279.0793667035552
 There was a glass pane in the front door , and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arranging flowers .	214.0282269127076
 Infectious hepatitis , he shouted heartily .	164.25201146866794
 She took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and , walking with very small steps , started toward the door .	420.41760775357227
 Oh , please come in , she said .	369.98933027195704
 The girlish voice was nearly a whisper .	67.19434562524292
 She was not a girl , he could see .	105.82840291257816
 Her hair was dyed , and her bloom was fading , and she must have been crowding forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight .	169.00091944565153
 Your wife just called , she said , separating one word from another , exactly like a child .	598.977981237231
 And I am not sure that I have any cash- any money , that is- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook .	439.81124567711487
 Wo n't you step into the living room , where it 's cozier ?	173.5429576348894
 A fire had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been set out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts was instantaneous .	250.40229489374522
 Where was Mr Flannagan , he wondered .	129.32919798868622
 Travelling home on a late train ?	349.87974942206927
 Changing his clothes upstairs ?	768.3589467219879
 Taking a shower ?	3090.3563459828956
 At the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers , and she began to riffle these , making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation .	87.27319107103853
 I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting , she said , but wo n't you make yourself a little drink while you wait ?	1149.8370874817006
 Everything 's on the table .	251.1766238129395
 What train does Mr Flannagan come out on ?	746.0697573431197
 Mr Flannagan is away , she said .	106.50455083625928
 Her voice dropped .	1900.258542234085
 Mr Flannagan has been away for six weeks h .	424.08322641784605
 I 'll have a drink , then , if you 'll have one with me .	214.7355819086942
 If you will promise to make it weak .	539.0536451450607
 Sit down , he said , and enjoy your drink and look for your checkbook later .	194.60381816320006
 The only way to find things is to relax .	258.7904869265483
 All in all , they had six drinks .	258.3357916116612
 She described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly .	410.7705131618105
 Mr Flannagan manufactured plastic tongue depressors .	981.8468827854633
 He travelled all over the world .	54.51234779769388
 She did n't like to travel .	338.12971449805406
 Planes made her feel faint , and in Tokyo , where she had gone that summer , she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home .	619.1401342238692
 She and her husband had formerly lived in New York , where she had many friends , but Mr Flannagan thought the country would be safer in case of war .	323.81922094994945
 She would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom .	1074.5597334405372
 She had no children ; she had made no friends .	249.55634495645577
 I 've seen you , though , before , she said with enormous coyness , patting his knee .	236.21965472360944
 I 've seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the convertible h .	1117.0104088703054
 The thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him , although he was even more touched by her plumpness .	398.69301850778504
 Sheer plumpness , he knew , is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions .	91.52698389850794
 It serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass .	360.9219463985622
 And knowing its humble place in the scale of things , why did he , at this time of life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness ?	307.2852668742917
 The remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he did n't know what to make of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook there .	370.62167996422346
 I 've never done this before , she said later , when he was arranging himself to leave .	423.9545214254881
 Her voice shook with feeling , and he thought it lovely .	581.3970782038341
 He did n't doubt her truthfulness , although he had heard the words a hundred times .	211.80419275553925
 I 've never done this before , they always said , shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders .	854.5016003197786
 I 've never done this before , they always said , waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor .	410.2255463420364
 I 've never done this before , they always said , pouring another whiskey .	842.9686435893128
 I 've never done this before , they always said , putting on their stockings .	279.85108103491746
 On ships at sea , on railroad trains , in summer hotels with mountain views , they always said , I 've never done this before .	888.2936828060451
 Where have you been ?	419.9667610863223
 Mrs Pastern asked sadly , when he came in .	359.45971346837206
 It 's after eleven .	275.6989680707747
 I had a drink with the Flannagans .	53.62585547727512
 She told me he was in Germany .	283.52263612568487
 He came home unexpectedly .	617.7569657423663
 Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the TV room to hear the news .	596.0807575746143
 Bomb them !	113.2172775172519
 he shouted .	744.8399648439337
 Throw a little nuclear hardware at them !	660.1830943182913
 Show them who 's boss !	1912.9295631759692
 But in bed he had trouble sleeping .	595.5294240153136
 He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college .	263.32203972119083
 He loved them .	154.88387016505604
 It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known .	99.63195488530056
 Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his handicap , his irons , his stance , his opponents , and his weather in detail , but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries .	374.2883764552866
 His money was tied up in a Nassau hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been running against him .	391.58987421708235
 His worries harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window .	212.69257397901782
 In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves .	217.75407687530316
 During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga .	220.98390772992704
 Maple and ash , beech and elm , one hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one hundred to win on Two in the eighth .	261.8886146700928
 Children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage .	565.3309891996192
 Then , getting back into bed , he thought unashamedly of Mrs Flannagan , planning where they would next meet and what they would do .	279.8119001021757
 There are , he thought , so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seemed , as it did , a little crude ?	279.01791162563603
 It was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years , not since their last journey eastward to witness their Uncle Izaak being lowered into the rocky soil ; that aside from due notification of certain major events in their lives two marriages , two births , one divorce , Christmas and Easter cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the widowed years .	415.2325740175621
 Her thoughts were not discrete .	973.1732698636507
 But there was a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons .	182.54114204951466
 She grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright , like a bird alert for flight .	924.234478874328
 She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty-legged escritoire , warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray .	231.4479375470594
 There she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters , one to Abel , one to Mark .	263.3753144674803
 Once her trembling hand , with the pen grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper the words came sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips .	594.1615710607543
 And the stiffly regal look of them , she saw grimly , lacked the quaver of age which , thwarting the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string .	219.51027550663014
 Please come down as soon as you conveniently can , the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen , I have an important matter to discuss with you .	262.15410127209174
 To Abel I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here .	281.7517809475488
 I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters .	647.2386061435146
 You may stay as long as you wish , of course , but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account , I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in .	355.5893422438583
 To Mark Please give my regards to Myra .	368.8090639808951
 She signed the letters quickly , stamped them , and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town .	375.5516298949352
 Then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water .	129.55785178112762
 My nephews will be coming down , she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining room , the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray .	334.03451366199886
 She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years ; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had faded to a near-absence of color which had , possibly from her constant looking at the water , something of the light of the sea in them .	177.50568444261407
 Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth .	224.24413388714285
 She smiled , and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face .	208.91540607624287
 That will be so nice for you , Mrs Packard , she said .	391.1112025512756
 Her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in Sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose .	578.0237226242791
 Um , said the old lady , and brought her eyes down to the tray .	191.63665334978006
 You remember them , I suppose ?	401.70873895019747
 She glinted suspiciously at the dish before her Blowfish .	86.05103594498502
 I hope Raphael bought them whole .	894.1290430677366
 Angelina stepped back , her eyes roaming the tray for omissions .	234.74665222175562
 Then she looked at the old woman again , her eyes calm .	366.4933365372633
 Yes , she said , I remember that they came here every summer .	340.70293814376134
 I used to play with the older one sometimes , when he 'd let me .	284.0878288696593
 Abel ?	49.38852082623447
 The name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips .	374.11192347974196
 For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile .	1061.575332054083
 She would have said triumph .	506.75550485205724
 Then Angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen .	473.4341368634448
 Jessica Packard lifted her head and followed the retreating figure , her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips .	428.5117895315771
 For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; then she snorted and groped for her fork .	227.3144880923274
 There 's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling away of a family .	367.2244846209956
 Procreation , expansion , proliferation- these are the laws of living things , with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments oblivion .	141.7367679877381
 When the fate of the individual is visited on the group , then the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted .	406.5844586610974
 And indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth .	503.68207832609954
 She was the last living of the older generation .	134.93299795391403
 What had once been a widespread family- at one time , she knew , there were enough Packards to populate an entire county- had now narrowed down to the two boys , Abel and Mark .	229.19461622062778
 She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans .	511.57256966578467
 What hope lay in the nephews , she asked the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sired two girl children , with none to bear on the Packard name ?	264.4709457981841
 She ate .	643.2630345824275
 It seemed to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table 's empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows .	403.8659272214026
 Here , too , she talked low , quirking her head at one or another of the places , most often at Izaak 's armchair which faced her across the long table .	245.96186635430382
 Or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed , consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years .	329.71289458321905
 She thought again of her children , those two who had died young , before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies .	528.7758340919631
 The girl , her first , she barely remembered .	431.58761241770304
 It could have been anyone 's infant , for it had not survived the bassinet .	177.16701054542506
 But the boy h the boy had been alive yesterday .	351.42315702802136
 Each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her .	519.6475744909578
 He ran on his plump sticks of legs , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire .	296.52054034083886
 In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her .	430.49331277608337
 It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea .	304.06165447903265
 The brothers drove down together in Mark 's small red sports car , Mark at the wheel .	894.0953357987876
 They rarely spoke .	676.0710661298514
 Abel sat and regarded the farm country which , spreading out from both sides of the road , rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields .	233.53453095624548
 He saw the land with a stranger 's eyes , all the old familiarness gone .	143.16647659238004
 And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself .	200.7082380139657
 There was stability there , too- a color which his life had had once .	365.6753842837922
 That is what childhood is , he told himself .	209.7115926303774
 Solid , settled h lost .	989.525123263288
 In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt Jessica 's letter .	692.2698237382536
 What bad grace , what incredible selfishness he and Mark had shown .	452.0227207160175
 The boyhood summers preceding their uncle 's funeral might never have been .	829.4486911829997
 They had closed over , absolutely , with the sealing of old Izaak 's grave .	137.3061662001138
 The small car flew on relentlessly .	261.615562554735
 The old woman , stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took on an ominous reality .	354.8389998215401
 Abel moved and adjusted his long legs .	480.976042915133
 I suppose it has to do with the property , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters .	203.21314006818403
 Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness .	208.85693337511188
 He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer .	430.95080587466805
 Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother .	204.34727006923575
 Mark held the wheel loosely , but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he 'd make in the years to come .	414.56230718543645
 His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away .	178.88188221830362
 Mark easily looked years older than himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized .	728.442992754407
 The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea .	912.2019466216989
 She did n't mention bringing Myra , Mark said , maneuvering the car into the next lane .	302.21137455382944
 She 's probably getting old- crotchety , I mean- and we figured uh-uh , better not .	169.5934888096746
 They 've never met , you know .	400.35642432954114
 But Myra would n't budge without an express invitation .	254.95876021410712
 I feel kind of bad about it .	350.64994040212014
 He gave Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel , hugging it to him , and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt .	192.3403319617941
 I imagine the old girl has n't missed us much , Mark added , his eyes on the road .	395.8249890229039
 Abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation .	519.1529415353845
 He smiled .	128.07940580635142
 It was barely possible that his brother was right .	268.7823854813306
 He could tell they were approaching the sea .	320.40689265889176
 The air took on a special strength now that they 'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind .	298.5023171610161
 There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt water , clams , seaweed and northern air .	201.31375007331457
 He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended .	272.06852948781767
 Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant .	270.7300448491787
 Remember the Starbird ?	188.91289286287142
 Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down .	268.43892742018915
 The Starbird , Abel said .	18.967828000569835
 There was the day Uncle Izaak had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy wished .	463.7257985783761
 The two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team h all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could .	571.1823789019622
 They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually .	174.6445667613112
 He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky .	434.11887205354174
 Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her sails .	163.08871569036648
 The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay .	75.09512982796001
 They came unexpectedly upon the sea .	477.7024391239042
 Meeting it without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them .	899.9515196207018
 They were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness , became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended .	535.5120087662029
 Mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water , which , there being no moon out , at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars .	425.73006195071355
 His eyes were old and they never saw well , but heated with whisky they 'd glare at my noise , growing red and raising up his rage .	665.6371900803531
 I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I could n't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling .	529.8855229630574
 Oh he 'd not care about the Pedersen kid .	307.06977482889016
 He 'd not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain .	286.22297769274985
 That would make him mad enough if he was sober .	483.39944109099315
 I did n't hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen .	244.83235309301574
 He was all shoveled up like I thought he 'd be .	165.03522986120262
 I pushed at his shoulder , calling his name .	294.84573713961066
 I think his name stopped the snoring but he did n't move except to roll a little when I shoved him .	289.2962205386674
 The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head , fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall- there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster- and I thought , Well you do n't look much like a pig-drunk bully now .	167.61273650391604
 I could n't be sure he was still asleep .	318.11686069228165
 He was a cagey sonofabitch .	11.360650956042932
 I shook him a little harder and made some noise .	438.8058583406018
 Pap-pap-pap-hey , I said .	33.779451974037656
 I was leaning too far over .	169.11623627513055
 I knew better .	317.47266811402505
 He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him .	334.50312949980156
 Oh he was smart .	389.5056658857809
 It put you off .	239.83651371221393
 I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough .	238.88821051209254
 When his arm came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck , watering my eyes , and I backed off to cough .	162.7089587551022
 Pa was on his side , looking at me , his eyes winking , the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow .	171.72681052494406
 Get the hell out of here .	479.0359429819832
 I did n't say anything , trying to get my throat clear , but I watched him .	363.63804866777167
 He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear .	216.98647433149333
 It was better , though , he 'd hit me .	220.38744583307758
 He was bitter when he missed .	299.89394881433753
 Get the hell out of here .	473.01741509639766
 Big Hans sent me .	2986.3809740753736
 He told me to wake you .	298.44326047036833
 A fat hell on Big Hans .	1800.868383485748
 Get out of here .	559.5817011470042
 He found the Pedersen kid by the crib .	56.985067441455854
 Get the hell out .	576.3487192387712
 Pa pulled at the covers .	777.8918932503296
 He was tasting his mouth .	49.97783350442187
 The kid 's froze good .	167.5327100151091
 Hans is rubbing him with snow .	1053.0535292250686
 He 's got him in the kitchen .	113.6027810483187
 Pedersen ?	48.45761138944398
 No , Pa .	435.00799159161556
 It 's the Pedersen kid .	88.63534495478332
 The kid .	187.86956377301325
 Nothing to steal from the crib .	40.03023179828824
 Not stealing , Pa .	1038.5690799580802
 He was just lying there .	140.73650898688473
 Hans found him froze .	303.7927061723733
 That 's where he was when Hans found him .	342.7830622565002
 Pa laughed .	3896.562261430912
 I ai n't hid nothing in the crib .	98.65214835375137
 You do n't understand , Pa .	421.03893699332116
 The Pedersen kid .	86.81785897066571
 The kid- I god damn well understand .	1138.7388603324466
 Pa had his head up , glaring , his teeth gnawing at the place where he 'd grown a mustache once .	344.3485169129516
 I god damn well understand .	3496.330169065144
 You know I do n't want to see Pedersen .	186.20756820782574
 That cock .	31.368445530407048
 Why should I ?	542.9117773169934
 What did he come for , hey ?	142.80698686722607
 God dammit , get .	176.5936015209976
 And do n't come back .	190.84735104999282
 Find out something .	147.62748612683512
 You 're a fool .	487.57535366319496
 Both you and Hans .	413.51946476727034
 Pedersen .	21.99278335101477
 That cock .	31.486810605317935
 Do n't come back .	361.1029484025103
 Out .	612.5200249054844
 Out .	618.5118466355335
 He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow .	280.567119992392
 He had long black hairs on his wrist .	183.38166477298623
 They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt .	24.084246498880123
 Big Hans made me come .	2025.3939677424848
 Big Hans said- A fat hell on Big Hans .	3338.2456192522627
 He 's an even bigger fool than you are .	743.4252176140467
 Fat , hey ?	24.90438175393906
 I taught him , dammit , and I 'll teach you .	156.06840741121044
 Out .	613.3361143213801
 You want me to drop my pot ?	1534.1469449745666
 He was about to get up so I got out , slamming the door .	120.22490428702335
 He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep .	221.55340574649543
 Then he threw things .	379.8249198691241
 Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister .	217.73103614197979
 Pa 'd been shit-sick in that pot .	611.3417871166546
 Hans got an axe .	365.6396689252139
 He did n't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa 's door down before he stopped .	420.89037670095104
 He might not have gone that far if Pa had n't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house .	647.2666442791083
 That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it .	1123.8678202803183
 I always felt the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out .	213.61647286570414
 I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs .	510.12739099296726
 Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid 's chest and stomach .	1226.3787864730662
 He was rubbing snow on the kid 's legs and feet .	431.46174319799303
 Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was turning pasty , sticking to the kid 's back and behind .	271.4033804798836
 Ai n't he going to wake up ?	303.15100422776226
 What about your pa ?	197.6888703789809
 He was awake when I left .	229.21344249032137
 What 'd he say ?	423.85104535463097
 Did you get the whisky ?	1178.577459429601
 He said a fat hell on Big Hans .	939.7280934044857
 Do n't be smart .	581.6670773908013
 Did you ask him about the whisky ?	802.4708654938222
 Yeah .	22.699571511048
 Well ?	575.3972567643863
 He said a fat hell on Big Hans .	934.824492008617
 Do n't be smart .	581.6241482593337
 What 's he going to do ?	292.12482995994213
 Go back to sleep most likely .	969.2493929255046
 You 'd best get that whisky .	1235.263349299273
 You go .	259.54075016991925
 Take the axe .	93.64102703370068
 Pa 's scared to hell of axes .	2301.461337694247
 Listen to me , Jorge , I 've had enough to your sassing .	160.11722644254837
 This kid 's froze bad .	315.8008517854111
 If I do n't get some whisky down him he might die .	437.5393977731473
 You want the kid to die ?	934.3291266776163
 Do you ?	665.99696549219
 Well , get your pa and get that whisky .	250.42074974385034
 Pa do n't care about the kid .	683.3154392794236
 Jorge .	21.921751135435507
 Well he do n't .	345.1576236436449
 He do n't care at all , and I do n't care to get my head busted neither .	251.73529578562918
 He do n't care , and I do n't care to have his shit flung on me .	105.25556257411444
 He do n't care about anybody .	331.01378763967057
 All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face .	695.0909065187489
 Get pig-drunk- that 's what he wants .	395.2563490005153
 He do n't care about nothing else at all .	314.11798602623855
 Nothing .	340.388944798114
 Not Pedersen 's kid neither .	664.6574516840502
 That cock .	31.395823374306932
 Not the kid neither .	876.4888019283638
 I 'll get the spirits , Ma said .	146.68781939808318
 I 'd wound Big Hans up tight .	4223.652509405499
 I was ready to jump but when Ma said she 'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran down .	485.52650639835065
 Ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off .	261.5915012077439
 Not any more .	349.0991438437827
 Not for years .	283.78950841365736
 The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he 'd cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she saw him heaving it again , the dirty sock popping out as it flew .	390.1627432057971
 It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa 's yellow sick insides .	440.73161804693297
 No you wo n't , Big Hans said .	987.1221887598774
 Yes , Hans , if they 're needed , Ma said .	245.62467475687848
 Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her .	1205.694684847116
 If we had , then one of us would have had to go instead .	204.02442895108112
 Hans rubbed the kid with more snow h rubbed h rubbed .	3985.585185622693
 I 'll get more snow , I said .	266.90120127819125
 I took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch .	76.0277209524046
 I do n't know where Ma went .	179.2394896650673
 I thought she 'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had .	700.850636951553
 She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she 'd go , and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat .	612.1135589950333
 Oh , he was being queer and careful , pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm .	133.14145510981524
 He was awful angry because he 'd thought Ma was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her h I know him h I know him h we felt the same sometimes h while Ma was n't thinking about that at all , not anything like that .	409.2430932570947
 There was no way of getting even .	153.5464526426356
 It was n't like getting cheated at the fair .	134.59247273263293
 They were always trying so you got to expect it .	325.594935082704
 Now Hans had given Ma something of his- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa- something valuable ; but since she did n't know we 'd given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back .	409.41017109722316
 Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap .	551.510894008705
 He was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she 'd done .	374.8675411555468
 Ma had found one of Pa 's hiding places .	209.16512263613058
 She 'd found one and she had n't said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the privy and found the first one .	274.6955656044151
 Pa had a knack for hiding .	75.95472087702838
 He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it .	210.85927889106983
 But now Ma .	44.95567102721656
 She 'd found it by luck most likely but she had n't said anything and we did n't know how long ago it 'd been or how many other ones she 'd found , saying nothing .	906.7497605998494
 Pa was sure to find out .	346.0808807337332
 Sometimes he did n't seem to because he hid them so well he could n't find them himself or because he looked and did n't find anything and figured he had n't hid one after all or had drunk it up .	333.1801845990739
 But he 'd find out about this one because we were using it .	309.41215037428486
 A fool could see what was going on .	537.1852446842735
 If he found out Ma found it- that 'd be bad .	436.0022915986564
 He took pride in his hiding .	88.32281373340027
 It was all the pride he had .	131.89486933483298
 I guess fooling Hans and me took doing .	650.3732897693742
 But he did n't figure Ma for much .	147.2909171569022
 He did n't figure her at all , and if he found out h a woman h it 'd be bad .	273.5030997987148
 Hans poured some in a tumbler .	344.46245203561875
 You going to put more towels on him ?	668.4997432761518
 No .	297.4901316762751
 Why not ?	615.3016214163839
 That 's what he needs , something warm to his skin , do n't he ?	272.39008037747925
 Not where he 's froze good .	165.93017554345454
 Heat 's bad for frostbite .	252.47732163193461
 That 's why I only put towels on his chest and belly .	726.1660609375351
 He 's got to thaw slow .	628.3222286766838
 You ought to know that .	277.99844286348196
 Colors on the towels had run .	182.1777248697619
 Ma poked her toe in the kid 's clothes .	210.76484602176342
 What are we going to do with these ?	265.9610809785968
 Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid 's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin .	826.5554792876522
 Here , help me prop him up .	158.50806861571448
 I got hold his mouth open .	520.8214664246836
 I did n't want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid 's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and did n't make any move to .	373.7619009173102
 Come on , Jorge .	225.86258357844994
 All right .	262.67019136685747
 Lift , do n't shove h lift .	141.04057058095037
 OK , I 'm lifting .	285.7705670183846
 I took him by the shoulders .	132.60839863860215
 His head flopped back .	117.95162748738385
 His mouth fell open .	874.2996522480073
 The skin on his neck was tight .	395.68516904798344
 He was cold all right .	198.90827619087784
 Hold his head up .	98.45940788278793
 He 'll choke .	389.053848294483
 His mouth is open .	306.482538619962
 His throat 's shut .	669.2792684282161
 He 'll choke .	389.24228470909355
 He 'll choke anyway .	1203.038846025044
 Hold his head up .	98.41380989460694
 I ca n't .	339.84308829517937
 Do n't hold him like that .	390.1385358825054
 Put your arms around him .	784.6143047009704
 Well Jesus .	1597.9735597823378
 He was cold all right .	198.50766077499563
 I put my arm carefully around him .	495.93049146095285
 Hans had his fingers in the kid 's mouth .	357.9440629176947
 Now he 'll choke for sure .	631.8589134555822
 Shut up .	56.727368283718135
 Just hold him like I told you .	459.04503001294273
 He was cold all right , and wet .	191.04403801939765
 I had my arm behind his back .	254.15302805515884
 He was in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing .	115.36567373915284
 There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; it was always the same unqualified success now .	288.6684052630447
 He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values .	304.96140608924486
 Stowey Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality .	231.86182628362164
 He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rose at half-past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop .	507.0517438414448
 This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist .	793.6359911059421
 The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor .	413.39414396966873
 His files , desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos .	633.6171348042238
 Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form his models , drawings , ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac .	251.57157144300155
 Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house .	225.24873639872087
 He worked standing , with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person 's hand .	395.93785230480347
 Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved .	199.96147540137042
 It all seemed- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows- as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler 's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss 's work .	191.31270034226443
 This air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine .	332.29103314092544
 But he was not bored at all ; he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it .	324.770341790569
 There are , after all , fortunate souls who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey was , as things go , a fortunate man .	291.2806179467362
 He left his home the day after New Year 's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat .	288.48886490589706
 He would wear this same costume in Florida , despite his wife Cleota 's reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him .	481.6756239285369
 But he was too busy to hear what she was saying .	285.63338569776005
 So they parted when she was in an impatient humor .	376.78213221710706
 When he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon , feeling in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before , she came out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head , which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window .	247.38938079220424
 Finding the key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog , and said , Defrost the refrigerator .	273.596210074655
 He saw the surprise in her face , and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen .	200.0869504473232
 He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him .	885.8431755928658
 He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it .	708.5528516363607
 He would settle himself into his seat to laugh .	408.93596248995226
 Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing .	323.07107933958036
 And she was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog , mad as she was at his going away when he really did n't have to , mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by .	439.88522344450433
 She was forty-nine at this time , a lanky woman of breeding with an austere , narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer .	247.62334625615233
 Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders .	770.3319367915512
 There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from money-making and which , besides , has kept its estate intact .	373.7238698905023
 She was personally sloppy , and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist , and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves .	227.7182082899319
 But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed , brushed , and taking breaths of air , and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy , a grace of history , so to speak , and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value .	308.5442625345956
 She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp .	631.1926640014709
 Now drive carefully , for God 's sake !	928.709171872062
 she called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure .	873.4495823015752
 But he did not notice , and was already backing the car down to the road , saying Toot-toot !	224.67484260445295
 to the stump of a tree as he passed it , the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed .	163.31975573918427
 She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road .	434.62819727604256
 Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window .	144.75645665886032
 She had begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell .	445.5948540017977
 He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once .	279.9253873090437
 Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said Toot !	752.5083782499858
 once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .	285.83124063245685
 She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building .	644.1712257693446
 There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind .	160.48290985948125
 She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the realest part of life .	418.20328370570235
 Now she could let out the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors ; she could dust the plants , then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on ; improvise cha-chas on the harp ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers , reading the ads as well as the news , registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire .	314.4834468148207
 She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting to be .	324.0023331756944
 She fell asleep leaning on her hand , hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm .	258.8645400837253
 Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers .	243.58812029364296
 Then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes .	340.3424266021148
 She stood up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests .	213.30543839579371
 She went into the living room and turned on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway .	292.96292845076346
 She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself .	532.810001621608
 They were both so young , after all , so unready for any final parting .	167.0434635730406
 How could it have been thirty years already , she wondered ?	667.9560630799702
 But yes , nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine , and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen .	297.2301568487413
 She stood still over the leg of lamb , rubbing herbs into it , quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath , a sensation of violence that started her shivering .	344.45072274784116
 But they all said , No , your time will come .	206.918283677389
 Enjoy being a bride while you can .	622.4307783534431
 There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning House where the Albright boys always took their brides , till they could get a house and a farm of their own .	220.10148658442836
 So when the Big House filled up and ran over , the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes .	454.2798337094726
 And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do .	279.47410375148417
 So Linda Kay gave up asking , and accepted her reprieve .	403.48848778069146
 Without saying so , she was really grateful ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joe 's wife .	682.2385919785721
 She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it spotless and neat , shabby as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe .	299.21822781372623
 She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this .	357.08840014220635
