 You mean dream ?	2642.824159031628
 Not exactly .	499.74839453491
 Just see it .	227.94309026365093
 Benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble .	333.3891076591585
 Nope , just you , all the time- sometimes I think it 's the only way I 'll ever get a decent partner .	278.87083857206795
 Ramey smiled but he thought to himself , I always see me too .	151.64146610920454
 Never Benny .	163.9275059723771
 Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt , Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind .	231.7170516400898
 Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think .	192.71973641034637
 With this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down .	100.39714331625648
 You seen him yet ?	414.5842850337547
 Benson said , referring to the Indian .	117.52374408740849
 He was n't in the car , Ramey said .	33.85241513122588
 You did n't go clear around , Benson said .	102.87062198069084
 If you want to see something , he 's back on the other side by the trunk of the car .	56.12236590330546
 Too long a waiting line , Ramey answered , pretending to joke .	667.5307490175703
 A few minutes later the insurance man , a road checker , drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state .	196.1555629196848
 It was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed .	427.573123607354
 Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed .	255.570860645302
 All the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges , the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane .	692.8502567176114
 Horsely , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist .	238.63261784248166
 It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist , an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head .	223.99742588731166
 The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men 's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town .	190.95751491486936
 He chatted with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer .	69.23203204100578
 Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear .	345.97759218758495
 When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer .	107.35762963577926
 There 's a body you wo n't mind looking at , Benson said and they stopped .	281.93413168707895
 She had driven up with her husband in a convertible with Eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that .	467.0299735947921
 She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt .	317.9880581470157
 Slender and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply .	290.13279801081006
 What outfit does she drive for ?	2559.0350794590895
 Benson said .	41.826927811595745
 Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey , a recognition .	138.031773933936
 She might have been someone he had once loved .	206.8658789193652
 He had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run .	96.91795149724048
 The truck routes , the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay .	525.3857833885286
 How would you ever see her again ?	342.8763987942879
 The feeling subsided , it was only a small yearning .	88.2379773760175
 Their work was lonely .	301.46232288401126
 What 's she doing in this bunch ?	529.300608505329
 Benson said , and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been .	187.1053580546833
 The girl looked around at the countryside .	169.0511933418481
 Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing .	1154.6267001634355
 It made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on .	316.5577049816341
 She began to watch a blonde-haired man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly .	172.43478883589995
 What had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but Benson knew what it was .	261.2116726263442
 The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson , in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real , said , You do n't want to go around there , Ma'am .	133.27972137028524
 The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her .	413.2683608258154
 The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car .	333.567035939981
 The two drivers moved closer .	657.3757123554634
 What does he want , a spoon ?	223.4763611236462
 Benson said to Ramey .	24.450503252430813
 One tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain .	234.05249141346673
 With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian 's foot that he would always remember .	278.9199616863029
 The laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top .	65.90965757409387
 The slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside .	226.0368663637882
 The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man .	105.45540053335573
 He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows .	241.4353789387525
 He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes .	231.28924782705792
 He was very tanned- big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster .	94.38483137464316
 He 's dead , is n't he ?	139.37580122199577
 the man said .	150.8125785150087
 He turned and bent over the body of the Indian .	130.52566972133684
 There was nothing in particular on the man 's face .	78.64852691224226
 It was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine .	154.25375812808429
 What 's this ?	453.9822111775929
 the man said , backing up a step , still looking down .	296.24899272522083
 His words were mostly to himself .	221.57317888903378
 Do n't .	218.2859355464267
 There was a gentle concern in Benson 's voice .	88.94608700566214
 Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man 's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded , blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement .	144.4988787042057
 But what is it ?	84.14937938482922
 the man said with a tone of impatience .	179.88711585508796
 But what is it ?	83.39191510327261
 The man had spoken only once .	209.45114675997914
 Ramey heard the words again inside , weakened , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears .	229.23838398697603
 The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey 's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man 's leg .	210.1623397290457
 Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin .	941.1833273277617
 He stared at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , Do n't do that , fella .	327.99782008618394
 Them 's brains .	138.76630620459008
 The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist .	321.7027639116738
 Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth .	160.7950118333349
 It was a straight , solid , once-in-a-lifetime shot ; he laid all four knuckles in between the man 's cheekbone and his chin .	193.18246032662753
 Ramey 's fist and the air expelled from the man 's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together .	222.29029547289724
 The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement .	383.37520114475655
 Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand .	243.0956008544908
 As he watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet .	328.61281505198946
 He had n't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard .	229.71196060792326
 With a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him .	159.8358223916821
 His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open .	207.21602312393497
 After what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it .	620.8501624820404
 The man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth .	266.10407849148635
 He moaned and pulled the hand away .	141.67533389363913
 Even yet there was no realization in his eyes .	132.20889597652882
 Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him .	404.9561566817777
 He did not look around .	56.02937534714319
 What happened ?	229.2785891915987
 someone said .	379.16608513981885
 He 's hurt !	309.0577541687906
 A woman 's voice said , and then he heard a sort of wail from the man 's wife .	81.48997310828504
 The man on the ground began to move ; one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him .	115.88954809928599
 Blood dripped down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright V woven into the neckline had melted , running a darker color .	271.75112789988145
 The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back .	191.4790357593554
 Can you hear , can you talk to me ?	277.76129207090776
 she begged .	111.12870682771417
 An incoherent , puzzled sound came from the red mouth .	332.80236358427703
 The girl looked around quickly at several of the people .	191.04713100269558
 None of the crowd had stepped forward to help .	276.3855325970361
 Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment .	63.26828219539066
 Why did you do it- why did you hit him ?	457.1148320153008
 she said , her voice rising .	391.4827470047276
 Ramey said nothing .	85.86251174996409
 A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again .	317.09662150597677
 Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers .	786.8444702491121
 No one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out .	317.33433570854885
 Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman .	231.05165076884728
 Benson moved his arms , gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly .	448.44355802038103
 Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man .	183.76092725139762
 Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey .	66.2898224418768
 It 's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them .	231.8867197477353
 Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer .	175.63413312910993
 He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman 's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol .	206.7537287433534
 All right , step back !	511.05102051704813
 the patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis .	223.64336391435506
 He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him .	173.65405828496938
 You all right ?	503.52711478660177
 Mough- it 's my mough , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips .	119.41855842435601
 His brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it .	446.9672588183845
 Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head- caught in the wicker back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute .	180.86865835749938
 The body continued to lash , but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome , bloody mass out of the bungalow .	85.57004055463976
 He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots .	124.45792810763601
 He heard their chattering , and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes .	153.26090040511306
 It was only then that he turned to look at Penny .	57.18149081428157
 She was sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her .	118.73823034981756
 The fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth .	154.31414273395782
 But her hands were calm , now .	251.89885240524578
 She 's got guts , thought Keith .	106.32107667930953
 She 's got more guts than any other woman in the world .	123.13279337230762
 Keith , said Penny , Keith , you were wonderful .	42.03612782275166
 I do n't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am .	204.00702319466015
 Thank you , Keith .	28.74296180796001
 He smiled at her sincerity .	254.55926135157537
 And for the hundredth time that week , he was startled at her beauty .	72.39300231032168
 Strange .	21.17148770930481
 Seven years they 'd been married .	567.0194745055162
 He knew her mind pretty well , by now , its quick perceptions and sympathies , its painful insistence on truth and directness , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate , even in part .	391.40831553956525
 But her beauty always surprised him anew .	1065.8969761426538
 I realize that this is hardly the time to say it , Penny , said Keith .	66.02235108645313
 But knowing you , I know that you 're glad to be alive , and grateful- and sorry because I killed the snake , even though I had to .	179.44832991958705
 Is n't that so ?	342.2157943790911
 Penny lowered her eyes .	385.1564115262916
 Yes , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime .	109.53537830574477
 The snake was beautiful , was n't it ?	196.01280352317588
 asked Keith , his voice getting harsher in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger .	200.75988311447608
 It was a king cobra , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , did n't it ?	123.88754458521798
 DID N'T IT ?	1840.0511825875633
 Penny did not answer .	73.2192143714587
 Now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him .	341.6592845388528
 We 're all God 's creatures , are n't we ?	384.1539570838836
 Keith was snarling now .	35.960384367992546
 All of us- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle .	76.81266475368804
 You love this village and these stinking brown people because they 're God 's creatures , too .	505.82759817696626
 And you love Ahmiri , that black bastard of a servant even a little more , because he 's a beautiful man .	226.12667952385146
 And he loves you because you 're a beautiful woman .	309.4461256261836
 We 're all God 's creatures , are n't we , Penny ?	243.765005634278
 All of us , that is , except me .	125.19544352790987
 You hate me , you hate my guts , because I like to hunt .	228.81573325912188
 You actually hate me- and we both know it- because I killed that filthy snake .	969.1541656290428
 h Well , why do n't you say something ?	393.10338745957864
 Penny would not rise to his mood .	92.07246377557364
 There is n't anything left to say , is there , Keith ?	90.8025591005925
 She softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader .	219.03513826850252
 He knew she was not sulking , not even angry at him .	94.81750925705677
 Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him .	195.007279071897
 The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world , the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet .	70.14740152769636
 For a brief period each year , the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls , and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon , and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long , meandering journey to the sea- running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga , then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam , past the Khasi Hills , and into Bengal , past Sirinjani and Madaripur , until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal .	170.90557211819453
 Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space .	306.8074685837213
 But Keith looked down more than up .	131.1409179043333
 He thought of the jungles below him , and of the wild , strange , untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the lords .	173.47837269044186
 At first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war .	233.1435491129097
 But after the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself .	111.0863108563787
 Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves .	213.18404680773514
 And Keith 's record of kills made him a man to listen to- a man paradoxically , who might even survive .	331.52906922420516
 He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates .	126.4948273145277
 The RAF was Britain 's weapon of attrition , and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war .	353.6149190215021
 He knew how to shoot down Nazis .	484.7864813849361
 And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it- because he was chemically incapable of fear .	157.94609529147257
 That was true , but only half the truth .	88.99577772500467
 The other half he did n't like to recognize , even to himself .	118.78388086406217
 He enjoyed the killing .	189.68246965096083
 Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity .	732.4631835887834
 He enjoyed killing .	564.6805072742187
 And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi .	128.3031247284734
 Nowadays , we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish .	63.1896458755805
 The Nazis bombed Britain , so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down .	143.1257105986636
 Not quite .	505.8289023198155
 It was a war of nerves , of stamina , of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis , who were better organized and technically superior .	293.1657491612052
 It took a long time before the British tipped the balance .	108.63415145221383
 Keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be risked .	252.32502923609835
 They grounded him over his protests- not including his true reason for wanting to fly and put him in the Command offices .	245.569061369958
 That was where he met Penny .	82.38694698960194
 He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , regardless of how important she might have thought she was in the Command offices , but that was all .	154.19510257608346
 Penny knew him better , on her part .	113.07100088400925
 He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals .	124.65981854049998
 They do n't go for bull-like muscle , as a rule .	97.19897974045236
 He had strength in his six-foot frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier .	49.5652265864399
 He was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep .	64.15923593967672
 His hair was black , already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom , the only one permitted to a man .	102.27833922353285
 The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles- and Penny , hating the cliche , had to admit that in this case it applied .	104.34246092439236
 Keith was an eagle .	19.76999761991182
 Penny and Keith had no romance .	90.646371627793
 No dates or hand-holding .	190.15101701466716
 But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly .	351.6768252060579
 The Command offices were in the border country , up north , where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports , and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy .	434.03177901901864
 The Nazis knew this , of course , and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit .	272.61022421605674
 This time , they had been lucky .	75.47674011734175
 The Command post was underground , and well camouflaged .	254.229341367585
 But there had n't been enough time to build it for keeps .	176.20991901821083
 There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as efficacious , when a direct hit comes along .	358.984398198428
 This one was actually more of a near miss .	284.5696714732356
 The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post , but not precisely into the Command room itself .	386.45568665105816
 There was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks , as ordered .	175.36933496487256
 That is , everyone but Keith and Penny .	70.07203515126324
 They stood there , just the two of them , in the rocking , shattering blast .	98.24788338753677
 Keith was on his feet because he did n't care at all about life any more Penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much .	216.21400625600532
 The bomb was a solitary one .	171.08776435533562
 The blast damaged , but did not destroy the room .	245.40066115484606
 Keith 's eyes met Penny 's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction .	299.0878569206752
 And , as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his .	189.20222752333544
 The chaplain married them , on the next day .	82.99670803864447
 After the war , Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her .	152.109610006441
 She came from Ohio , from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres , as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers .	226.8759324026388
 But to Keith 's London-bred mind , such acreage sounded rather invincible .	227.8054158856741
 It was n't that , however , which decided them not to go to America .	79.45728884563425
 Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma .	203.11869182355065
 He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles .	71.4022849630703
 He did n't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself .	267.61083891815514
 He could n't stop killing .	170.50054910309868
 That was his true love , not Penny .	92.05255609093139
 The terrible power of a gun , the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose .	145.46016325264657
 And in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing .	176.61981676950785
 When they got to Shillong , in Assam , he was happy .	38.11776327466555
 This is a paradise for hunters .	105.76978935502399
 This was the land of the sladang , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread .	328.817116841166
 The great black leopards .	79.96967084173858
 The sambur buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk .	52.570717804187595
 He even hunted elephant , although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin .	478.55259154928603
 But there are big rogues in both countries .	138.74639057333687
 These were the ones Keith sought out- the loners , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself .	179.49308251688856
 He and Penny would go out on tame elephants , raised from babyhood in the keddah .	76.99346546253925
 And while he was ever alert for game , and most particularly a tiger , Penny marvelled at the Eden they were traversing .	191.35650341914263
 They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools .	301.0249575112611
 Peacocks strutted across their path , preening .	56.674751964019784
 There were fantastic flowers without perfume , and gaudy birds without song .	663.2979347272479
 Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close .	364.4610631317241
 Wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted derision when they did n't consider such game worthy of a shot from the .404 's .	149.89324860142256
 Now , the next morning , they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms , with the weighted line beside it ; and Robinson Roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface .	258.1285270031346
 He and his safety man , Herr Schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together .	146.60864414017777
 The German courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first .	528.9332516161959
 Robinson clambered heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his triple-tank assembly .	374.98192497116327
 He was frowning .	9.905808541588803
 He took his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck .	158.20827606073112
 Temper , temper , Mrs Forsythe said , laughing uneasily .	109.8591018647413
 A phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty , but irreparably stringy in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and tonic , though it was not yet ten AM I loused it , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice .	234.74472049126544
 All I have to do to set the record is to go on down .	130.40178779391948
 So instead I come up .	279.1624981223197
 Was it my equipment ?	1356.370377698173
 the German asked .	783.769036791551
 Was it something went bad with the breathing ?	1295.8221151226282
 The equipment was fine , Rob stated , standing up .	300.16185268980445
 He was a huge young man of twenty-four , clothed in muscle , immensely strong , with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation .	201.13595555129191
 He stared stonily at the floor .	58.11749284798107
 I was down to 275 .	24.852613923874618
 I 've been that far half a dozen times .	251.77316281909688
 I do n't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick .	354.62606941369665
 Well , I get it , Artie said , still on the ladder .	78.10910167471219
 You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record .	172.2001923774496
 And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself .	315.6007038571815
 So you turn around .	321.3784399792583
 No , it was n't that , Rob said .	107.39958323076539
 A note of awe came into his voice .	225.3531437202963
 When I came up , damnit , I thought I was going down .	52.16656226516342
 I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening .	371.69777333759424
 Pressure-happy , Artie said , and climbed in .	63.13115204651119
 That 's right , Robinson said .	158.40683623807917
 I was expecting it , sure .	191.41560960642164
 But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you 're a hundred feet from where you thought you were- well , it makes you think .	177.7584262682013
 You do n't head back down again .	147.75347395066478
 Not me , anyway .	307.75136503936744
 Not right away .	310.2729224810155
 He had his voice under control again no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him .	242.36350757435704
 Waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat .	76.13445500104076
 Now he was going to show how much he knew .	114.9369942690057
 Our boy did n't chicken out , no sir .	473.4184747750418
 He ran into the rapture of the depths .	35.24739148868718
 Nitrogen narcosis .	12.75646510861462
 It makes the diver feel drunk .	199.26300742276356
 Well , that 's the only way to be , Mrs Forsythe said , and gave her brassy laugh .	126.90250699912502
 Maybe not , if you 're 200 feet under water , Artie said .	249.69981359496518
 Anyway , Waddell went on .	50.11594455752896
 it 's nothing to fool with .	689.418417259912
 It can kill you .	209.59173620025769
 Personally , I do n't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story .	179.67940673741666
 Nobody 's giving anything up , Robinson said .	496.83107348697445
 He stood there , towering over them all gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; and yet like a child among adults .	328.3608057661698
 You think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ?	317.671478521225
 I 'm going down again .	121.92837753156168
 That 's my boy !	323.10062527295844
 Mr Forsythe exclaimed .	420.4202519356223
 Rob 's not going to give up as easy as all that .	431.46489225816293
 He was a florid , puffy man in his early sixties , very natty in his yachting cap , striped jacket and white flannels .	83.54058306964285
 He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of Commodore was never used without irony .	253.06090503587356
 Old Commodore Forsythe , who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first .	487.98512226548024
 Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again Rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride .	179.54457894264158
 Why , he went on , when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I did n't think twice about it .	118.69801276926793
 I 've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother 's tackle shop .	636.3327568474697
 Hell , I gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven- how many years ago was it , Rob ?	225.5507842929019
 Seven years ago , Commodore , Rob said impassively .	187.595353828147
 He was thinking , big deal skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started .	351.3854268639578
 Excuse me , he said abruptly .	92.67400117896318
 He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters ; went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him .	155.66148197453487
 When you got ta go , you got ta go , Mrs Forsythe said .	110.77443282930908
 Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge .	415.19108918327754
 He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley .	108.17689534262558
 Hi there , Schaffner , he had said .	18.931181942283285
 Can I make you one ?	387.6555535641539
 No thank you very much , Schaffner had answered in his accented English .	213.69409566702726
 I do not drink so much , thank you .	207.22781349535109
 Waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up .	115.98621029051003
 He was in his early forties , rather short and very compactly built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways .	186.47500716844937
 His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence .	299.8452632583855
 Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel 's Afrika Corps , and he said to himself I 'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night .	76.71826451442446
 Aloud he had said , making conversation Rob tells me he 's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive .	251.42361693728827
 Yes , Herr Schaffner had said .	243.02976972412222
 He 's one hell of a decent boy .	246.08023078762253
 I like that kid .	341.8436160024105
 I agree , yes .	145.5416344191951
 And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right ?	242.33524770617302
 Well , no , Herr Schaffner said .	289.3119720464001
 Waddell turned to face him .	71.33820477874892
 No ?	537.3543918942327
 he asked .	136.85062178756954
 But that 's what he told me .	126.21854824882075
 Why , that 's his main reason for making the dive .	149.3499405193617
 Shaffner looked at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands .	172.6520716768043
 What do you mean ?	216.2359844111617
 Waddell asked , frowning .	31.629533282500635
 Please let me explain , the German said earnestly , his face still devoid of deceit .	356.3896996069615
 I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year .	471.8007379445828
 Now I wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong .	126.1867389975887
 I must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products .	288.9235422356728
 With all respect to a fine young man , Mr Roy is not able to provide these necessaries .	136.78464464287882
 Waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard .	61.79805351307172
 Did you tell him all this ?	468.94972036437775
 he asked .	132.42882041574737
 Perhaps not in so many words , the German said .	248.70108484136784
 But surely you have misunderstood Mr Roy .	293.5883981002891
 Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights .	384.85865380195526
 We spoke of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity .	149.69658708789015
 He was most eager to make the dive ; of course , I was willing .	61.28177885992752
 But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements .	334.2950784490358
 Well , damn , Waddell said .	167.3975360630562
 There was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline .	55.72022065797786
 He started out the door .	108.10771381298203
 One moment !	447.1812996201666
 Herr Schaffner said .	385.90395026058593
 You intend to speak with Mr Roy ?	550.3952830833695
 What else ?	393.4001515906533
 Waddell asked .	64.54952663292289
 If you will pardon , I think it would be better if not .	72.30612120463756
 Mr Roy is determined to make this dive .	103.8794731119548
 Whatever you tell him he will dive .	132.15288164951363
 I know this from my talks with him .	196.6331675447369
 Well , let 's let him make up his own mind , OK ?	188.81780668508634
 Waddell said .	39.9701900444062
 On the basis of the facts .	47.80393015167713
 You will make him unhappy and anxious , the German said .	309.51818747774996
 At 200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him .	232.06796404186372
 It is not good , Mr Waddell you will do him great harm .	144.0548035696588
 There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said .	237.72292662179734
 Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .	111.5535406952534
 I am an honest man , the German said with fervor .	135.55214233996386
 I will give Mr Roy his due for this dive .	218.22949353772748
 I will make him distributor for all of Florida- a big market .	211.9838521307109
 All tourists come to Florida .	1154.1042728409393
 This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop .	174.68674029954073
 Yes !	673.3760101709424
 But there is no use causing him to worry at this time .	133.55407007845102
 The German 's words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty .	176.96361045984648
 He took a big swig of his drink .	66.52327288902943
 It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this .	169.1052820391734
 I think maybe you 're right , Schaffner , he said .	128.9933904430851
 He has the distributorship for Florida , you say ?	117.16588859923384
 Yes , the German said .	173.185142608408
 At least for South Florida .	747.4244339044162
 By God , Waddell said , we do n't want to upset the boy at this time of all times .	100.94144492917069
 I guess you 're right .	339.6666952328945
 He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps .	81.85250517825384
 The story was shaping up nicely in his mind the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America .	318.35656964186546
 Join me in another ?	960.7596406438716
 he had asked .	67.34170374979402
 Thank you , the German had said courteously .	66.77866589982148
 I do not drink so much .	120.44425791640013
 Now , in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk .	471.9061764327909
 Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions .	352.8577603829346
 He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper .	263.27011724367185
 Blessed Saint Nicholas , I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered .	281.6507590274033
 And when I make the dive again- He paused ; crossed himself ; said a Hail Mary , slowly and with understanding .	682.3207132397015
 Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to Headquarters .	343.7010760644438
 Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive .	309.5537839093005
 Make it come off all right .	613.9528228606013
 Let me set the record this time , and let me get back OK , so the German will give me the exclusive .	257.54432590317003
 And make my life different and better from this time on .	461.88790702125243
 Amen .	3450.3908601324015
 He crossed himself again and rose .	190.18358255525584
 He felt a good deal less shaky .	110.37793068035903
 As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk .	161.5415883642251
 Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger .	49.233869110687486
 He waited awhile before he said , Roy , you know your decompression table , do n't you ?	163.75151974413015
 You know I know it , Robinson answered warily .	162.06466062942545
 You came straight up from 275 without a stop , Artie said .	150.70731032202752
 Well , I was a little bit confused .	159.49012734191155
 Anyway , I was n't down long enough to matter .	79.03378577951653
 You do n't see me stretched out on the deck , do you ?	224.14010345469336
 You know what they say about two deep dives in one day , Artie went on , still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently .	111.55644496975351
 I do n't think you should go down again .	91.99690908651327
 EARLY that day Matsuo saw a marine .	239.6688269608133
 The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery .	241.3026777321802
 As his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand .	172.85328927075196
 He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed .	258.8605927268601
 In the leafiest part of the tree , straddling a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow .	53.263337110836616
 For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .	324.3432329911396
 He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably bred indecision , they would soon come hunting .	243.6940584977605
 His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure .	313.6723809853713
 Yesterday ; today ; tomorrow no surrender .	911.1311627313281
 His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace- only a faint chill of doubt .	407.0826123251562
 He murmured to himself , with firmness No surrender .	297.99599244343847
 It was best to die fighting the marines .	127.0646838067582
 His superiors had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor .	243.19057386523667
 What if the marines never came ?	110.41374010269583
 His comrades were all dead .	341.4763988823051
 He had no rice .	96.53114313480899
 Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .	198.62553268832204
 Whichever the way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes .	151.35814294260868
 He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk .	151.6197312488918
 His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .	645.9318427328056
 The knife , an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt .	264.99213844870354
 Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth .	381.2148432183371
 As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing .	127.27171844156373
 Gloom receded .	12.872349211634825
 The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though debating whether to brave the sunlight .	227.77714904495824
 His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist .	163.57821804966028
 Come out , come out in the meadow , Matsuo said under his breath .	126.00595954860202
 The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face .	219.83115060209292
 A signal ?	560.6368700157511
 Matsuo lifted his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness .	232.4390109536401
 Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills .	281.19094279390276
 They had fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out .	109.48836313573524
 Even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows .	112.341351733702
 A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing .	168.7363016495448
 The marines let him advance .	258.2237963419206
 When he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy .	122.95262756128348
 Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses , both the burned and the unburned , the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun .	101.27011251304067
 The callous marines had laughed at each other 's retching , while stacking bodies .	136.29778096081995
 Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea .	47.887882065048
 At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle , reeking of death .	53.771987288531996
 Apprehensively he peered to the left , to the right into the leafy , vine-crisscrossed maze .	59.489905860103924
 He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow , with the one left to distract him .	35.18603420475545
 He strained his hearing .	289.84052663062363
 Cautious feet stepping on leafmold ; faint creaking of belts and slings ; whispers he heard none of these .	283.46161322819756
 Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird .	158.5704709259034
 Because he could n't hear them , he was more convinced they were there .	102.9727438409349
 A spectacle occurred across the meadow the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it .	126.90465990151694
 Humiliation made Matsuo tremble .	213.03395729423772
 While his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver .	182.2237012752271
 Taking aim at the man 's face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind .	190.93247017629548
 He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .	167.6003173084371
 The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound .	228.33552130884374
 Hush followed .	106.72804947089396
 Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment , Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle .	264.6400608116089
 How stupid to give his position away .	289.1968439086126
 The jungle did not retort .	23.779100470233494
 The sitter remained seated hugging the tree .	491.18083145496513
 Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy , and insects hummed and birds occasionally called .	217.49246333005132
 Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke .	213.77479309778874
 Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes .	1159.8007693623226
 He went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind chasing of the tail .	121.9421200955219
 It ended when he tumbled ; but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction .	268.9109218036328
 He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon .	321.7482015229829
 With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo 's direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop .	58.08863510854929
 When he got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face .	189.8110027052706
 The pockets of his jacket bulged .	171.47018074723297
 Hand grenades .	6494.797909673838
 the bobbing head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk .	106.76663835288731
 The marine spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward .	165.45098694656642
 In the hush that followed the echoes , Matsuo was tense .	125.10604032709364
 They could come on him now without difficulty .	149.39569105445815
 Gradually he reached a conclusion .	81.96434459802315
 The marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree .	226.08289776813092
 Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage .	403.20507354877816
 The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended .	1105.2299610992184
 Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out .	234.6924001503266
 Reflex ?	51.07350877060789
 Rifle leveled on the man , he made a rush .	100.77080174075198
 Heat , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd .	290.21899982494955
 He squatted by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground .	136.6007081345988
 With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back .	342.10247449130486
 He was bearded .	149.36978084994226
 The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone ; around the hole , blood glistened in a little patch .	171.85112150346185
 Maintaining his clutch on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets .	169.42340733619744
 In one a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man 's bleeding .	195.35803004942645
 In the other a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief .	317.61201212491454
 One by one he tossed the objects aside .	634.0200567076196
 He did n't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter ; he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running .	332.91079437376777
 Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .	240.87444303560974
 Too bad the marine had no water .	562.3527212201873
 From its holder he took his own canteen .	118.53349367031485
 The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure .	218.89310073587413
 The marine 's eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened squinted in the glare .	218.73335236432055
 So , alive .	264.41412456343465
 Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .	165.11113118750654
 The marine reached up a hand .	368.35826875012754
 Matsuo shook his head .	101.44220468746416
 None for you .	489.57436011131784
 The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand .	230.87690957728324
 Not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on .	266.3643628491876
 You came well equipped to die .	404.2210277980671
 Some odor made him lean over the man .	496.3825687797707
 He sniffed and recognized it .	76.66625696354079
 Sake .	20.597255910541787
 So that had been his difficulty .	102.77875914358152
 Drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac .	56.07179145372757
 The marine tried to roll on his right side , and moaned .	173.90363890595341
 When he rolled on the left side , propping on his left elbow , Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over .	172.3163731123076
 Be a good turtle .	1100.8812342574458
 Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle .	239.01250081191967
 The smell of sake had freshened yesterday 's events in his thoughts .	296.3570354445455
 In the caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake .	135.46532251393876
 The marine shut his eyes .	797.9791932914943
 Are you a thrower of flame , marine ?	410.58040979869224
 Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine 's reach and away from their shadows .	176.4220981011156
 He waited in his squat , gripping the hair .	48.96178893620118
 Every so often he turned the knife .	429.7445312278276
 Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .	792.0452630415801
 The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping .	117.60026205207464
 Wet also were the marine 's fatigues and the face had an oily film .	213.42669357598808
 The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes .	174.11727109570631
 Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle .	213.0207156180966
 He must have saturated himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze .	121.05901277965562
 Matsuo shook his head .	99.71413507755925
 Strange .	20.96592137079756
 At last he reached for the knife .	276.06285588996633
 Even the bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine 's handkerchief to wrap it .	145.7549475193538
 First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes .	288.2617919760437
 The marine yelled and flung the hand away .	87.22513993202135
 With a firm grip on the man 's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek .	428.44061769079303
 A shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo 's wrist .	58.31071528967998
 Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat ; burned the other cheek ; burned each hand when they came groping again .	510.43808193522653
 The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment .	328.1438712556881
 Matsuo stood up .	75.81264287357519
 A small measure of payment , marine .	539.3991592184396
 He dropped the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder .	203.19141719602047
 The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach .	229.5401156035359
 He ceased weeping .	1240.29939088342
 Matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back .	157.0529884277832
 The marine was still .	177.48767455016682
 He would soon die .	137.4428750318116
 As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow .	149.85572888582846
 What now ?	185.73735803144723
 In the jungle , birds were mute , while insects preserved only the monotony of living .	173.22120687595464
 Someone called .	739.6350156760343
 It was the marine head lifted , he strained and called .	345.3728089377349
 Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat .	229.99174535503226
 He cupped his mouth and yelled .	32.757573478071116
 Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder .	158.59395190513808
 Once and for all he 'd finish this marine who would not die .	384.28026756414204
 He aimed , but listened .	243.94702619969405
 It sounded as if the man were calling him Hey , Japanese h hey there , Japanese .	213.58976389129768
 The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container .	227.40272948815036
 He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .	401.8899463965611
 Sake ?	52.89849155769148
 Matsuo called .	104.76934931091824
 The marine nodded vigorously .	2739.678971305661
 Matsuo laughed , slung the rifle .	89.01170902293894
 The marine was a winehead .	51.200436500560315
 His superiors had said that all marines were depraved .	36.101765443723984
 The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol .	677.4180599436114
 Remembering his own thirst , Matsuo took out his water bottle .	150.80928276676823
 One swallow was all he would have ; he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline .	184.10594994869723
 His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline .	173.27012797251146
 He began to uncap the bottle , the rusty cap squealing on its threads .	100.05655753587851
 Popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted .	346.7808170468213
 Of course it was water he really craved ; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out .	149.41342304948267
 The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack .	362.1466128796164
 Matsuo shook his head .	100.2854199259816
 He had no water for an enemy .	74.02205095392398
 And when this was gone , he had n't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool .	106.7305328970629
 He capped the bottle and replaced it .	88.86604103454178
 After all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine .	180.34041805050057
 Before much longer the marine quieted down .	421.0422759099335
 His head slumped .	82.17251000278851
 The upper part of his packet had stained dark .	156.03007150660858
 Marine .	4247.865529892114
 There is nothing for you , Matsuo said .	66.72121838656625
 Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion , besides the dishonor of it .	140.5891783155988
 I 've nothing for you .	175.06253501992543
 From the convulsive quivers of the man 's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping .	124.7148523912969
 He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China .	228.65844476382742
 In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , smudged , blood-specked , with the village burning about him and shells exploding .	287.0890611010149
 CHAIRS SCRAPED BACK and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar .	969.3287363096241
 Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were .	392.51311896730715
 Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame .	198.07185245003723
 He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed .	122.87893715888636
 Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys ?	311.5606887792038
 he asked .	135.15458560942426
 Seems to me I do n't remember altering any law about that .	163.40317206714573
 He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer .	481.11412715433784
 Stay right here where you are , kid , he called .	232.81700119126168
 I do n't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I 'm a-drinking The stranger ignored him .	417.97612794380365
 He did n't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader 's right hand was on the butt of his revolver .	342.92510254664364
 I 'm Billy Tilghman , said the stranger , and I 've come for Pat Conyers ' body .	210.6609598417067
 And what makes you think you 're going to get it , pretty boy ?	249.05363714143203
 Because I 'm asking .	340.8798954989751
 Most of the time I get what I ask for .	176.14437233903925
 Blue Throat winked at his six cronies .	85.64842005272071
 The kid has no manners , boys .	588.089153026152
 Shall we teach him some ?	1151.121833870917
 His gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster .	147.2390172755056
 Tilghman 's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin .	216.0385991895353
 His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling .	226.48935879870584
 Tilghman leapt on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him careening against the bar .	108.84388923820475
 A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman 's stomach as Blue Throat 's henchmen started shooting .	565.8469702772335
 Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun .	319.6797551874172
 The Colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing .	218.9248849265257
 A third shot doused the light .	148.388818981077
 Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , You all right , Billy ?	286.9100057402683
 Yes , George , but I ai n't got poor old Pat 's body yet .	839.1756168088929
 And I aim to have it .	102.74595360541076
 He fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed .	248.12438146669692
 Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor .	289.7874802086308
 OK , Tilghman , I 'm quitting .	16.856913959503967
 And me , said another Blue Throat henchman .	107.44004041696735
 Somebody brought a light .	430.6871027264265
 Tilghman and his partner , George Rust , herded the men into a corner .	81.12703003689553
 And now , said Tilghman with deadly calm , I 'll repeat what I said .	178.01657507733103
 I 've come for Pat Conyers ' body .	323.23623861651765
 In two minutes the body of Tilghman 's former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town 's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial .	216.81088737933996
 Blue Throat , nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight .	264.5893122701047
 That critter will be back tomorrow , predicted George Rust , and he 'll bring fifty of his kind back with him .	156.78334926630347
 Blue Throat wo n't stand for this .	446.3511149797332
 He 'll shoot up the town .	108.59414243188907
 The prediction was correct .	171.93308501014795
 The Reverend James Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers ' last rites on Boot Hill in the township of Petrie , when shots were heard in the distance .	193.70291696358305
 Amen , said the Reverend Doran , grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone , and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere .	148.0026071110986
 Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle .	266.25881147250976
 Blue Throat , who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months , certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship .	214.3817169476665
 It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring , ruthless gun-slinger , and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it .	154.9897565580058
 He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street .	155.54544189350014
 The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn .	200.5899474622725
 Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat 's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire .	855.8406234675116
 The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster 's Store , halfway down the street .	124.31558922857009
 Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived .	721.8061703961217
 He sized up the situation and shook his head .	75.36671659156771
 If Blue Throat has his way he 'll keep us all cooped up in here for days , he said .	216.26140076280663
 There 's only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store .	159.47433539202154
 He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom .	148.66889380159955
 Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite .	650.907581682242
 I 'm gon na drop these into Blue Throat 's lap , he announced , and I 'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window .	462.8925969531908
 He slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways .	101.55441807553511
 Blue Throat 's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed .	378.020752368332
 Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber 's shop and came out at the back .	170.93850160644428
 Here he could n't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang .	118.45350566680001
 All he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through .	240.312216471514
 Billy Tilghman did just that .	331.86852679915427
 Within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters , with every outlaw either dead or injured inside .	347.56488090378537
 It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat 's dictatorship in Petrie .	114.79017632846298
 Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts .	541.1028108594113
 To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising , smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet .	211.03789347902926
 Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West , Uncle Billy Tilghman stands out head and shoulders .	485.1218489691606
 He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book .	111.5925367692403
 He saw the most action , beat up more badmen with his bare fists , broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other US marshal who lived before or after him .	284.1942268578982
 For fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West .	454.56328023902995
 The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career , his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung .	186.80103506058114
 Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century .	264.1337372805245
 He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890 's .	307.6422611646108
 Led by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns .	331.76317538391703
 Bill Doolin 's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him .	196.30814387966134
 Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .	54.5380664482422
 They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses .	190.8771931701988
 Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort .	755.1992249474434
 On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn 's ranch .	386.81778954907145
 It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .	178.8638789913651
 The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was belching out thick smoke .	229.63484518279063
 The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .	453.4046760967303
 Wait here , Neal , said Tilghman .	83.60408286662027
 If I do n't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse .	312.1429232121107
 Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it .	83.68479963537303
 There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside .	220.0722160361514
 Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day .	808.3281277121723
 Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed Dunn .	293.25943233860335
 Hello , Ed , said Tilghman .	82.79630874953095
 The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but did n't move .	177.79981148151816
 Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire .	215.2266810259673
 Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck .	164.38480752592824
 Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain .	301.71685849756466
 And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman .	216.27560146737773
 The fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide .	271.79128079446537
 Thinking fast , Tilghman never hesitated for one instant .	481.7030990210714
 He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him .	222.9113846135735
 The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang- every man a killer .	260.5919056318866
 Cold day , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire .	260.4480679776989
 Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives .	427.1436032013999
 Ca n't seem to locate landmarks in this snow .	400.67904052672907
 The rancher was trembling .	228.0293383939488
 He would n't look Tilghman in the face .	35.6584660260673
 Follow the river for five miles , he said hoarsely .	217.84380100761075
 Jed 's homestead is on the south bank .	82.97035472937627
 Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes .	417.7715993829669
 All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body .	584.2485561017284
 One false move on his part and he would be a dead man .	157.67959379251727
 Well , he announced , Guess I 'll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the warmup .	94.86687469910818
 He strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him .	74.83211368512413
 He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive .	428.29188247228393
 But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon .	278.59451259925953
 If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .	425.5783691827406
 Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown .	240.88221185808686
 Do n't say or do anything , he said softly .	187.0535100660091
 Just get out of here without it looking as though we 're in a hurry .	381.2084427100222
 That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang .	173.62734587693987
 Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman 's life hung on a thread .	543.0262414985558
 Back in the house a hoodlum named Red Buck , sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then .	440.9700597959123
 You 'll stay right here , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle .	507.19584065829747
 Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back .	205.3796482443915
 We 'll let him go .	211.58137180706976
 But the fighting marshal 's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , Oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets .	359.0884730314842
 Wiley Lynn , a self-styled prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since .	791.3172233191492
 That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy 's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver .	568.516296133197
 FOR SEVERAL MONTHS now , Jack Carter , a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy , pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a Woman .	94.94142201128089
 This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth ; she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately .	220.93288045225415
 When she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach .	238.19562237554342
 Then he would run to the toilet behind the house .	107.27547445121348
 Sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this Woman was almost always with him .	143.2903364979126
 He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him .	277.0175930489739
 But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right .	140.50221837584266
 And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the Woman of Jack 's mind assumed the teacher 's face and figure .	150.60677121943013
 He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do .	135.38998503433362
 When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh .	106.00384889554368
 Miss Langford her first name was Evelyn was an attractive girl .	264.76568831172784
 Tall , blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress .	193.52553735905877
 Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack .	188.74624128292325
 She would look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick .	163.48978283219998
 School began in August , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another .	189.22163981378645
 The first two or three days they went home early .	363.42947258032484
 All , that is , except Jack .	180.71128456404105
 He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order .	141.0844883902221
 Once this was on the third day of school she kneeled down to pick up some books where they 'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg .	270.9061660891391
 He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating .	298.38340578058217
 About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she did n't even see him .	173.0284569919438
 He jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school .	91.03116402017103
 He did n't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; then he slowed to a walk .	103.19034599105245
 The vision became even stronger now .	421.4978539387242
 I 'll get her yet , he muttered to himself .	202.9453913217943
 I 've got to get her .	103.66964715364925
 That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire .	236.582426171326
 He ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily .	280.54277023680226
 What 's the matter , honey ?	169.96641498384363
 she said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child .	84.09505210758925
 Are n't you hungry ?	924.7172052494684
 No , I 'm not hungry , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs .	143.29354107971557
 Outside it was already hot at 730 AM , and it was getting hot in the kitchen .	284.7861013232723
 He felt a little sick at his stomach .	168.27171068310201
 Are you sick ?	1207.155844615235
 No , he said .	47.51141854549296
 I 'll be all right .	81.85938302938506
 I guess it 's this hot weather .	411.75697372069465
 Do n't you play hard today then .	701.0509791871717
 And if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early .	450.9238152333046
 Daddy left the car for me , and I 'm going to town this afternoon .	134.66502828369613
 O K , I wo n't play hard , he promised .	469.4620754462847
 Just then Charles Lever yelled , Hey , Jack , from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling Good-bye , Mom over his shoulder .	149.1774949437212
 Whaddya say , boy ?	257.74455732993835
 Charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth .	317.26302501837466
 Charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , scraggly , with straight black hair like an Indian 's and sharp brown eyes .	419.156142349361
 He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .	273.1767122211861
 You know what I done last night ?	383.747552862551
 Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .	268.73843698475616
 Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were Charles ' only apparent interest .	443.87742026985234
 But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles ' revelations even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention , so he usually invited them , as he did now .	262.57328884459645
 No .	282.8775065398543
 What ?	250.46671464053804
 I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry .	223.2525371479309
 A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack 's mind .	548.4482220964449
 His heart beat faster .	2141.9326034713904
 Hell you say ?	128.69212912303854
 he said , lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles .	147.74653195446678
 How 'd you do it ?	245.40455690674963
 Hell , I jist got on top of- No , I mean how 'd you get her to do it ?	199.22820862427133
 Hell , I jist ask her .	82.70829008300258
 Jist like that ?	126.73098230807979
 Hell , yes .	39.633009749275054
 She 's been hangin ' around me a lot here lately , and I figgered I might as well 's try it .	287.9004128461289
 Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin ' it .	252.32602313624554
 I never heard that .	110.15398801302968
 It 's all over Branchville .	62.36320865873167
 If you 'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself .	343.1277850898036
 I might try it one of these days , Jack said wonderingly , thinking of Miss Langford .	167.90372174503568
 WHEN THEY reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse .	377.0503706044183
 Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .	101.4352646651198
 Time for books , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand .	282.4252958632613
 Let 's go inside .	401.0650008180739
 Oh , come on Miss Langford , play with us just onct , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully .	127.51618718088268
 No , not now , said the teacher .	129.023121542025
 Maybe at dinner time .	762.919470382088
 Come inside now .	1236.4073216314264
 The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse .	129.22481858398825
 Jack watched Miss Langford all morning .	1065.2146545378084
 He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider .	438.1627960836001
 Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he coud hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did .	255.4614477991762
 At noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball .	347.9696761621755
 Why ai n't you playin ' ball ?	746.3551437489941
 he asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse .	116.08808433207473
 Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised , several of the little girls called .	255.85185901010854
 I 'd druther stay here and watch the girls , Charles grinned .	399.59482295348505
 Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we 'll see up their dress .	391.42519506586234
 Maybe , Jack said idly , watching for Miss Langford .	195.8070057426061
 Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .	68.34039085260164
 When she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , Goody , goody .	97.2685647326658
 Let 's play with 'em , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants .	244.6297845805978
 OK Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls .	168.43162727949775
 They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap .	567.9342536891207
 Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head .	225.04701400653894
 While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , Gosh , I 'm sorry , Miss Langford .	232.9775099225609
 I did n't mean to pull so hard .	141.06286871749467
 That 's all right , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes .	116.67252704252458
 It was my fault .	92.51010799354782
 With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack 's extended hand with the other .	515.182919592212
 When her hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet .	400.6758725610856
 He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .	295.68400046737224
 Thank you , she said , dusting herself off .	78.49063748479244
 Will you play with us again , Miss Langford ?	249.4761810953397
 one of the little girls said .	165.5124891152532
 No more today .	398.8758993633957
 Maybe some other day .	336.26171824397534
 Oh , shucks , the girl said .	55.18723597163648
 I do n't believe I 'll play any more neither .	310.237357066354
 Me neither , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone .	378.3750823385882
 Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun , past Robert Allen 's three-room , tarpapered house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes .	243.32511756959897
 When he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up .	42.16205535710368
 He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class .	170.08725492971607
 That should do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work .	125.92458804051871
 He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he could n't take a chance on either of these possibilities the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school .	225.76252116649223
 The only drawback now to the plan he 'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack .	297.36710074009574
 But I 've got to take a chance on it , he told himself desperately .	139.48403701925358
 To his surprise his plan worked perfectly .	926.2304077909532
 All right , if you ca n't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school it out , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling .	308.54151867825783
 You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems .	1098.215283787218
 And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home .	287.84986870529315
 He scarcely saw them .	209.09516027900688
 His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , How will I do it ?	275.3034094781355
 On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise .	195.55449139987044
 She munched little ginger cakes called mulatto 's belly and kept her green , somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck .	406.4341022212963
 The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman .	289.53829242639506
 Lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family .	162.25800867729887
 The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured Look at your watch , Col Garvier .	386.2034650596549
 It is almost time for and calinda to begin .	125.81990824591873
 Col Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans ' most important and enlightened slave owners .	1245.8964318873439
 He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start .	149.66436655519507
 The slaves ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name .	301.72977573145675
 Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum .	568.4305614764289
 He showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently , his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy .	93.57523577025333
 The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds .	211.5597796698025
 The dance was of Haitian origin .	124.78341560881468
 The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows .	235.30741799125985
 He was possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners .	136.3439781774548
 He proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the South 's oldest and most cherished names .	213.9364769453357
 Delphine was a pace-setter in high society .	48.815164713788356
 She was a top horsewoman and one of the city 's most gracious hostesses .	82.53826976955382
 Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil .	166.38629750761635
 Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders .	407.0502375515365
 The slender , handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves .	219.92726202168527
 He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race .	438.7690828399743
 But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his master 's plantation in Bayou St John .	260.02935275231357
 Shy , actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls ' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses .	204.77930765919433
 This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near .	433.19693557705
 The woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection .	286.40105193353367
 What is your name , boy ?	227.75531965874467
 Come a bit closer .	1735.5065491158985
 I wo n't bite , you know .	237.35114887378066
 He gaped at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her .	214.41366146965626
 Then he smiled shyly .	86.40080405525613
 My name is Dandy Brandon , missy .	42.69264292032284
 I belong to Master Alexander Prieur .	388.7570781805427
 She said with intense feeling Come near , let me feel your arms .	1090.5846371376451
 You look quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy .	235.00600583794002
 Mrs Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage .	369.92692413063264
 Lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm .	171.1461423632876
 The woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor .	94.86777305043411
 Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees .	185.97215022623558
 Satisfied at last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver .	162.73689798010096
 This was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows .	30.972613965151897
 Aristide !	43.431922914905265
 I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy 's purchase .	251.62958720791306
 There 's $ 600 in gold in this chamois sack .	106.69592798953455
 If the old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer .	436.6143782243469
 Prieur has gout and depends on Louis ' pills and bleedings .	98.1079213543798
 Besides , he owns 300 slaves .	746.2193262235196
 One less should n't matter to him .	250.7618334213302
 Aristide Devol , the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native Sierra Leone , smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat .	102.66486182823483
 His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .	336.3887732382259
 Another youth , Madame ?	909.8707591171211
 the coachman said softly .	198.99795181361932
 This one is a tender chicken , oui ?	259.7169468017836
 Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh .	1255.8659931079567
 It will rip and shred easily for Madame .	156.8107186641839
 Be quiet , Devol !	358.5029746629613
 You are forgetting your place .	120.29062584959158
 The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur .	210.10853737822998
 Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon- cowering in the back seat of the carriage- to her mansion at 677 Perdido Street .	63.82869012216641
 Dr Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion .	118.92766120745853
 Dandy , curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle .	168.52813011173623
 He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head .	146.82578930205264
 Dr Lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket , and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses .	142.10045627685915
 He was about 50 years old .	173.75108279874374
 Another young man , my dear ?	491.8017946520004
 Really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself , he said , frowning with displeasure .	61.15270523744623
 Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster .	76.68850644673286
 Dandy is to be our house guest , Louis .	261.40426272670396
 I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways .	268.8162930942537
 He deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation .	201.4827859557629
 Quite so , my dear .	670.1152018129408
 His room will be ready shortly .	288.0283350170602
 The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave .	244.3164920805446
 Had Dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries ' tender care if he valued his life .	298.1526699257458
 But he liked the smell of Delphine 's perfume .	113.20901447912745
 Besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth .	145.2365400088159
 Also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony .	259.71494570847074
 So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home .	103.96110809735512
 Airless and dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St John .	221.53780961387173
 He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie- after closing the door- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber .	254.3742591118063
 It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell .	141.27058124629352
 When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street , he was carried out in a coroner 's basket .	84.17062288147139
 JUST six weeks after Dandy Brandon 's arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New Orleans ' oldest and wealthiest families were invited .	297.5785354667525
 A stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms , and Delphine circulated graciously among her guests , chatting airily of the forthcoming races , the latest fashions from Paris , and Louisiana politics .	171.96317376471112
 Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase .	80.9870239320772
 It was Dandy Brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him .	52.500738046603765
 The lad 's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts .	467.9151732882171
 His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .	159.76103414506207
 Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted Evil woman !	461.8177881742931
 You did this h you like to hurt h to beat people h I want h to go home .	418.68196748212563
 These were the last words he ever uttered .	368.0791197147985
 Convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore .	88.70133618041395
 Dr Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead .	294.8881986167942
 The ball broke up in confusion .	300.63006892157557
 Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures .	538.5586778461645
 Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse .	188.2532047605543
 But at the coroner 's inquest Delphine told a forthright story .	41.24381732793689
 I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him .	304.48737871656436
 It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest .	220.07135335539803
 After I paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night .	187.97093900081936
 How he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , I can not say .	82.32804657762532
 Dr Lalaurie and I did n't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs .	113.1564322167169
 She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion That poor boy !	468.18606018071785
 He must have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced .	236.47422922515
 Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die .	383.1597739317644
 Such a pitiful end !	148.73143030730688
 Though the slave 's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner 's panel , Dandy 's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded .	136.09866396758852
 The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury did n't feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady .	126.68689076849678
 Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans ' dives .	974.3006343505061
 So the verict was death at the hands of a person or persons unknown , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine 's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold .	127.5424883578153
 Once again life went its serene way- soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners .	1038.749810436887
 The excitement over Brandon 's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie 's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital .	292.1405913241283
 Then , on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip .	196.82902723944133
 Mrs Victor Dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight .	313.3884070008844
 The manservant Devol and his mistress , Delphine Lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion .	45.68900796992654
 The girl was not more than 16 .	85.98698805708369
 She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back .	444.5436122023326
 The bleeding girl was tiring fast ; the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street .	263.2441644961718
 The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice Help me , somebody !	151.7187279029299
 They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw !	336.8036784545986
 Bastards , he would say , all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me !	111.27805301150329
 Since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent- and even indecent- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero , he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper .	155.61659943049202
 There ai n't nothin ' faster , or lonelier , or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wan na go someplace , Feathertop would say .	148.35240954514137
 The accommodations may not be the poshest , but man !	77.29933193070019
 there ai n't nobody askin ' for your ticket stub , neither .	673.7139987741912
 He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now .	60.537490415961884
 Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child .	70.41888352862087
 Ever since all that .	549.9365924005939
 It had been a very long time that had no form and no end .	77.42533106329664
 He was- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own- riding the dark train out .	145.00550842836643
 Out and out and never to return again .	359.2272972725479
 Till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped .	134.88835062646825
 That was the day it ended .	126.45569157154738
 THE FREIGHT CAR WAS COLD , early in the morning .	74.00592584593116
 He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .	110.46338747482864
 He held his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly .	98.43874755197503
 The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn- then with a clash into its slot .	253.98689739435105
 The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .	132.7025301498264
 She pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and Feathertop 's music pffft-ed away .	371.0387450775065
 Now that is a very nice , a very nice , he murmured to himself , back in his corner .	192.62658143870456
 A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted .	216.90880591089532
 Hot , that was the word , hot !	237.8253796771314
 Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow 's wings , with the sun shining down over them .	128.254281223997
 A poet , yet !	200.88258020929285
 His thoughts for the swanlike neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however .	171.2803536488248
 Zingggg-O !	42.87936600870594
 Then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting .	348.5163023635996
 He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .	116.52710035476272
 Curly hair , high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer 's blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes- but then I 'm finished .	139.83591877873485
 We made it , Cappy , the chick said .	35.0739482133873
 Yeah , seems so , do n't it , the boy laughed , hugging her close .	118.68784719393896
 Ah-ah !	44.11127219560746
 Feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants .	41.27546479720599
 None of that .	218.34571372707447
 We run a respectable house here .	364.4744998355515
 They whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall .	226.7950431124631
 He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes .	111.56760005256281
 He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .	335.1792703966419
 Come sit , said Feathertop , motioning them toward him .	151.57818337402423
 That crap is softer over here .	76.43138207556626
 The girl smiled , and started forward .	228.13186342796666
 The boy yanked her back hard , tugging her off her feet , and gathered her into the crook of his arm .	131.24855899073373
 Now stay with me , Kitty , he snapped irritably .	137.3342042769835
 I vowed to take care of you- and that 's what I 'm gon na do .	114.58478727804463
 We do n't know this guy .	130.18903678957764
 Oooo , square bit , Feathertop screwed his face up .	386.04462731505606
 This guy was strictly from Outsville .	197.72558250726937
 But nowhere !	623.4826767683187
 What is with this vow jazz ?	155.84044321343038
 Feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight 's vibrating wall .	137.93241183498927
 We- we eloped , Cappy said .	36.551668865302545
 His head came up and he said it defiantly .	68.49205675660728
 Well , congratulations .	33.836013157251436
 Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .	245.0015267390203
 These two were going to be easy pickins .	113.56015457913277
 They could n't have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much .	109.25503713631888
 And besides , the chick had a little something the others did n't have .	208.30592287414208
 That was gon na be fun collecting !	739.1372951124275
 But not just yet .	265.6544458368197
 Feathertop was a connoisseur .	12.115308583308089
 He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it .	92.07339179683723
 Come sit , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings .	283.8123730908541
 I 'm just a poor ex-jazz man , name of- uh- Boyd Smith .	128.45738527301282
 He grinned at them wolfishly .	110.97737072910185
 That ai n't your name , Mister , the boy accused .	204.0678571276699
 And you know- you 're right !	201.54466811154794
 Feathertop aimed a finger at him .	188.72115677243963
 Oh , come on , Cappy , the girl chided .	80.68656888888496
 He 's okay .	20.26238494091831
 He 's a nice guy .	254.0022663073973
 She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her .	640.2673714933219
 Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle .	273.24206989367605
 He cleared his throat ; it had been a long , hot while since he 'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin ' distance .	306.7296163897988
 He had it all doped , of course .	40.922041588456985
 Slug the kid , grab his dough- at least enough to get to Philadelphia- and then have a rockin ' ball with the doll .	144.9141728676791
 Hmm- diddle !	25.810860529726273
 Where 'd you come from , Mr- uh- Mr Smith ?	448.02552982669215
 Kitty inquired politely .	116.68786032591296
 Where from ?	1534.3640822004108
 he mused .	64.73877123863042
 Out .	588.7932637470042
 I been riding train for a ways now .	416.47221112169893
 They lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself .	111.6876403666142
 After a while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , We 'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly , honey .	279.5946243907593
 What 's the matter , she wan na go the bathroom ?	191.1031347325372
 Ernie found it immensely funny .	1056.040113853105
 The boy scowled at him , and the girl looked shocked .	111.45902021304893
 No !	532.9972354330102
 Certainly not , I mean , no that is n't what I said !	184.02872519388717
 she snapped at him .	375.00225352154683
 I only said I was hungry .	210.2360107711765
 We have n't had anything to eat all day .	183.5347497755592
 Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill 's voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .	355.80840579704113
 Why n't ya say so , fellow travelers !	951.7563643977666
 Why , we got dinner right here .	314.78415811090264
 C'mon , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we 'll have food in a minute or two .	232.2534119741458
 Cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .	40.87630065274013
 Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .	685.7262648048161
 He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it .	424.58871707362283
 He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .	265.2277569997667
 A charcoal pit , man , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier .	107.2893397243634
 Fan it , he told Cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper .	82.60779324068754
 Yeah , but what 're we gon na eat ?	147.61036999390046
 Charcoal ?	53.00806230462689
 Fella , Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man , you try my ever-lovin ' patience .	170.2993031890719
 He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners .	246.452823876633
 Hot dogs , man .	1194.0748390828555
 Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides .	163.02953933557856
 He ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil .	241.88771717844432
 Almost immediately they began to sizzle .	170.67813081768708
 He looked up and grinned .	112.95844513396347
 A Kroger 's self-serve , he explained .	30.564877354724604
 I self served .	756.536406351757
 WHEN THEY HAD LICKED the last of the wieners ' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette .	117.58472283205577
 Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad .	140.49375524088484
 How come you 're riding the rods , kids like you ?	350.2588549421329
 Ernie asked .	64.55222735754168
 Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply .	114.91210797815964
 But surprisingly , Kitty 's face came up and she said , My father .	149.6187199204707
 He did n't want us to get married .	108.34000264628544
 So we ran away .	174.54223382038586
 Why did n't he want you to get hitched ?	111.25514641185421
 This time even she did not answer .	179.104904169346
 She looked down at her hands , too .	112.81881740347595
 After a few seconds , she said , Dad did n't like Cappy .	79.76833277115034
 It was my fault .	92.79007402732154
 Cappy 's head came around sharply .	247.27808495960008
 Your fault , hell !	1076.0014076584096
 It was all my fault .	112.9090729263604
 If I 'd been careful it never woulda- he stopped abruptly .	438.2314539890431
 Ernie 's eyebrows went up .	51.430789489519036
 What 's the matter ?	123.63143273287713
 The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , I 'm pregnant .	280.2243397091355
 Cappy raged at himself .	43.565745436308774
 Oh he was stupid , her old man !	393.12629288019855
 You never heard nothin ' like it Kitty 's gon na go have an abortion , and Kitty 's gon na go away to a convent , and Kitty 's this and Kitty 's that h like he was nuts or somethin ' , y'know ?	130.8552117353054
 Ernie nodded .	161.24162884696662
 This was a slightly different matter .	162.7753045199258
 He remembered Midge , and the child .	51.00579484301165
 But that had been a time before all this , a time he did n't think about .	93.53928974713122
 A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out .	150.77520769973427
 But these kids were n't like him .	187.47205154395337
 Oh crap !	186.6852740474045
 he thought , Pull out of it , old son .	103.66172297816294
 These are just another couple of characters to roll .	404.7653249830466
 What they got , you get .	153.274851480981
 Now forget all this other .	544.0811585076855
 Wan na drink ?	241.17527074490548
 Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket .	199.53778562881328
 Yeah .	20.892231116690773
 Now that you offer .	199.28881715301335
 The answer came from the open door of the boxcar .	47.89349912467422
 From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade .	242.60400159412208
 Ernie stared at the man .	59.77523723498077
 He was big .	72.34112889752633
 Real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly .	262.25673492873557
 Road gang , Ernie thought .	823.0733517718293
 You gon na give me a drink , fella ?	187.66879459935183
 the big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar .	126.9588346551244
 Ernie hesitated a moment .	350.3076581480843
 This character could break him in half .	273.244566017552
 Sure , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips .	106.41747995640755
 He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder .	42.56413876037501
 The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring .	332.73827073698305
 He took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .	162.73119331812197
 He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously .	93.64119717099454
 He belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .	215.43680641971568
 Well , now , he said , and reached into his pocket .	85.75542625749402
 I did n't know I was gon na have company in this car .	111.94957825360767
 We 're going to Philadelphia , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more .	373.8448646398493
 No , I do n't think so , said the big man , and it was the final clincher for Ernie .	54.60842161947717
 He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it .	136.35903080424282
 Maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ai n't goin ' nowhere .	399.5936987193599
 He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car .	222.44281000721315
 Ernie was screaming inside himself No , damn you , you ai n't gon na take my meal ticket away from me !	913.8282574140984
 The newcomer stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth .	118.70678623562678
 Her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard .	187.66990024377213
 The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump !	258.89115109439274
 and carried him backward in a footballer 's tackle .	229.93905325557344
 They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs .	252.01500598985052
 The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back .	155.38388736720748
 The fist went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man 's deeper voice go , Aaawww !	308.21080887584435
 Then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade .	105.17252484433139
 He held the knife aloft an instant- an instant enough to press the stud .	356.5504445049534
 The blade came out with a snick !	118.22487584783607
 He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid 's throat .	91.81364089837845
 Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .	181.94581015440633
 She grabbed at Feathertop 's sleeve and shrieked , Help him !	58.66003274130766
 Help him !	70.55521300672079
 Do something !	657.7453499283109
 They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man .	1740.187875030533
 To them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after Mass , and at noon , and at six each evening- its tone , repetitive , monotonous , never breaking the boredom of the streets .	276.2419134468111
 The Old Man was unimportant .	470.63765591671864
 Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June ; or the smell of thick tomato paste- the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour- rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth .	236.82869886859456
 Or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights .	231.85295585573763
 Or the bay of female dogs in heat .	863.61580047256
 They never called him by name , although he had one .	103.84022091144602
 Filippo Rossi , that 's what he was called in the old country ; but here he was just Signore or the Old Man .	106.07862535165047
 But this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders .	292.0516410731207
 Youth obeyed when commanded .	1140.6202966037645
 It went to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession .	469.0746091241778
 But youth asked nothing of its parents- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing .	192.4123915337652
 The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened .	677.0684573036324
 But the past was dead here as the present was dead .	125.6030138831016
 Once the Old Man had had a wife .	201.9699200007445
 And once she , too , ignored him .	174.69228001934158
 With a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders , she wiggled her satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and did n't stop .	169.6462909790723
 In one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase .	282.5584462071708
 The way she strutted down the street , the Old Man would have been blind not to have noticed both .	207.97493828568247
 Without looking at him , without looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars , rode away in it , and never came back .	368.2009928955906
 But she should n't have come here in the first place , the women had said .	65.0876145826025
 No , no .	227.43523370700254
 Not that one .	195.26136345924175
 She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from Torino .	175.4437660258599
 Eh , Torino !	17.878685276735396
 She gave herself fancy airs !	1559.0172039232093
 Just because she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours .	209.56462488569252
 They had slapped their thighs .	18.962671549064662
 It 's not for making pretty speeches about Dante those actresses get paid so good .	536.433821588666
 Henh !	43.97747494655792
 Calloused fingers , caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries , had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted , never to be tweezed away .	125.6581257425587
 Mauve-colored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man 's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again .	189.80373184683063
 Puttana !	44.23836549291974
 But if the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a fig .	754.7943305501046
 It was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed- watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance , as thin as the seams on her stockings , and still thinner .	88.09112399934386
 His voice had not commanded her to stop .	221.9740079367767
 It had not questioned why .	210.8816094005484
 The women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him .	317.85895852881947
 He was never without that dog .	164.719318157583
 And his eyes- those miniature sundials of variegated yellow- had not altered their expression or direction .	199.0710311714049
 The Old Man 's very soul could have left him and flown down that street , but he would n't have had anyone know it .	136.41955397357597
 Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife .	369.27470751288604
 But when he called for his withered , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar ?	146.01830572042053
 There seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him .	296.3304479771045
 For all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in Italy , not the outskirts of Philadelphia .	117.2879117676807
 It could have been Bari or Chieti for the way it smelled .	75.06682075318622
 What did it matter to him that the park at the foot of Ash Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city 's center at half-hour intervals ?	514.0307035351974
 Or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the Schuylkill ?	998.1281025322866
 This place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness .	185.84395991131262
 To him they were one and the same .	86.67897158998002
 Sameness for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city .	292.1479217213088
 Sameness lined the streets with two-story houses the color of ash .	999.6808981729097
 It slashed the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches .	532.5739763503806
 It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors .	37.197810308769256
 Even the stable-garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it .	175.5253673415732
 And the coffee shop on Drexel Street , where the men spent their evenings and Sundays playing cards , had a rose hedge beneath its window .	697.9976099633134
 The hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it .	116.76187803022782
 Only one house on the street had no lawn before it .	233.93523809631455
 It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade .	516.7265752657479
 That was Bartoli 's shop .	68.89845922208605
 Above it , from a second-story showroom , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood .	205.42031411135386
 Did the Old Man remember them there ?	1278.0610626357604
 Yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks- like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery .	148.50183473169525
 Only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences , where one man 's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy .	186.50610807216012
 Love and hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by fig trees and grape vines .	273.5164770304539
 And the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch .	1240.748693359844
 The Old Man silently fed upon these streets .	1736.7328904161711
 They kept him alive , waiting .	248.37164505317637
 Waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not .	319.418997139103
 It was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price .	68.87486638302683
 He was holding out for something .	103.9020663242514
 He was determined to hold out .	53.74752504927757
 2 The Old Man 's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich .	225.30628520792297
 At fifteen he did n't care that he had no mother , that he could n't remember her face or her touch ; neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him .	287.4921666145504
 He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have cared less about that either .	168.5328062414123
 To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .	544.6225505169446
 When he would be a man , he would be a rich man .	39.64054604380842
 He would not be like the rich Americans who lived in white-columned houses on the other side of the park .	106.54243779482215
 He would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning .	146.2927405619062
 He would not carry a brief case .	80.8544330324367
 Nor would he work at all .	161.96892324749822
 He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step .	401.89349754054354
 He would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , bowing with her running , calling out in her bowing , At your service .	238.4667585057368
 He would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff- he would not remove his gloves- and light and smoke .	204.2816938139013
 He could do that when he would be a man .	32.27753314575366
 Hey , Laura !	107.59298081479241
 he called to his sister on the porch above the steps .	269.7694189570384
 She was only ten months older than he .	382.0736883285008
 Laura , what would you say if I smoked a pipe ?	211.4200041856424
 Laura did not answer him .	128.85186808113446
 She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , gilded hair in the sun .	602.4761948097375
 One lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking , torn pales .	126.04494248095072
 Her tanned foot , whose arch swept high and white , pointed artfully toward tapering toes- toes like fingers , whose tips glowed white .	592.094563959893
 All the while she sat there , her sinewy arms swirled before her chest .	289.461050623345
 Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii .	343.73349435570015
 It was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours .	142.8390539455065
 The eyes , blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality .	195.5837491325356
 Even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance .	88.64748259137521
 He was never sure they fully took him in .	282.71332058128365
 Pompeii called again , Laura !	250.28974314480698
 But the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it .	273.93158431825145
 She 's in a mood , he thought There 's not a month she does n't get herself in a mood .	221.87433027017497
 Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ?	390.6797825775163
 And as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him .	155.69809402636014
 Not even Laura .	653.5134776630382
 Suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat 's claret tongue , feasting against the salt taste of him .	111.80864809145082
 Above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , sallow and time-cast , encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin , stared unfalteringly at him .	196.2635519270268
 Christ sake , goat , git !	163.35878320560383
 But the goat would not .	39.50589818019557
 You 're boiling milk , ai n't you ?	1533.0450318118053
 soothing it with his hand , knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch .	38.9224889642805
 Pompeii rolled over .	286.3120694900441
 His head undulated gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats .	209.61010079351112
 With his mouth opened wide , he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light , earthy taste of it .	295.85367214794474
 The boy 's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did .	246.8751857278514
 Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud .	161.9009060617448
 Its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane .	73.01704829053246
 But the boy could see only the goat 's belly .	91.13190738409058
 The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it .	488.52448392923384
 He knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he would n't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog 's back .	201.2627273307934
 There would be time enough , perhaps the Old Man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due .	220.0793903539554
 Time enough to give up his soul .	215.43478139352254
 In the meantime , six sandals , stained an ocher , the same color as Pompeii 's shaved hair , edged up close to him .	143.99405407010468
 The clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks .	106.56146838173342
 He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to Niobe , the neatest ones to Concetta , and the laced ones to Romeo , Concetta 's idiot brother .	66.30939226778253
 Pompeii expected Romeo 's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground .	295.7329987876687
 He expected Concetta 's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything .	157.02973258957576
 People came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it .	367.662548992186
 The room filled with smoke , and Maggie 's head throbbed with excitement and fatigue , but Stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that Maggie could n't bear to do anything to quench it .	291.85568735436095
 Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery .	1163.378561062408
 In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head .	245.3890118353738
 She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her .	546.9532245534891
 She was so heavy that Maggie 's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her .	419.50705716084997
 Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .	182.0034786241414
 Worry had a great deal to do with it ; Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father 's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him .	212.2833941571119
 Mr Clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife 's people without contributing to his and his family 's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap .	462.7960917674618
 Maggie and Stuart pored over figures every night , trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more .	323.16628179528635
 In desperation Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon Do you think you could find me something I could do here at home to make some money , so I could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things ?	306.92466429644594
 It seems to me you have enough to do as it is , Eugenia said .	82.37439123273299
 She had been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again .	204.34191780696918
 I have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing something , Maggie said .	179.69217939851885
 It would make me feel a lot better , but the Woman 's Exchange is n't taking baked goods any more and I ca n't leave the baby with Grandma because she is n't strong enough and the baby 's too young to be put in a nursery .	322.5534301558077
 I should think so , Eugenia said .	79.54829348746937
 For one thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day .	601.6014821577783
 She 's so beautiful , and I do like to keep her looking nice .	271.6444426719658
 Maggie said .	41.340398371424044
 She picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck .	589.2033310110174
 She 'll be just as beautiful in something that does n't have to be ironed , Eugenia said .	102.7772362005472
 Evadna Mae Evans said she did n't put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old .	124.46593428434413
 Evadna Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from Best 's Liliputian Bazaar in New York , and I 'm sick and tired of hearing about Evadna Mae Evans .	186.61038020895637
 Well now , Maggie , you do n't have to snap at me , Eugenia said .	59.26432211135711
 I 'm just thinking of a way for you to be sensible .	168.16030671303557
 I 'm sorry .	269.8691384639785
 I do seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think of a way to make a little extra money .	124.72884045636634
 Well , let 's see .	180.9811033469076
 Let 's make a list of your assets .	264.0616005339301
 Maggie started laughing , and she laughed so hard she could n't stop , and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining .	319.037468714693
 When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures .	270.32297001606196
 I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers , Eugenia said .	223.10061130891427
 We could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it 's nice and sunny , but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that .	281.73899227756465
 What else ?	423.7050715832145
 You might set up a dress shop in the living room .	234.323259695744
 Every woman in the block has tried that .	279.46765550662593
 What about a tea room , then ?	251.59595943339528
 You could set up tables in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread and Grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes .	473.79038288027374
 It 's too elaborate .	228.37120854794762
 And Grandma is n't strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am I .	254.7180829522842
 Eugenia sighed .	223.4951478443177
 She said , Well , those are the really interesting things , but if you do n't like any of those I can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough .	265.7152104277556
 Oh , I 'm sure I could do that , Maggie said .	89.08526342639436
 But it really would n't be fair , taking your jobs away from you .	226.02084243252577
 Do n't worry , I can get plenty more , Eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could .	254.6665830416184
 Maggie was looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be brushing up on her typing so Eugenia would n't be ashamed of it .	186.4109285914456
 And then whenever I have a minute I can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time .	152.91948442680595
 And I can go back to my contests and be thinking while I 'm doing the washing .	229.6715294096941
 What are you going to do with your feet so you do n't waste anything ?	406.0969905030919
 Maggie laughed .	140.9676923202429
 She said , Oh Eugenia , I wish h What ?	185.65683640784917
 I wish I had three wishes , Maggie said .	162.74799124163664
 All of them for you .	205.1188787096308
 It grew bitterly cold toward the end of November , contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people .	283.03571696292784
 The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days .	380.0301617807622
 The cold settled like a tangible pall over the Mile High City , locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance ; it had a look of grim stark realism , resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold , instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy Western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources .	352.98983821660363
 The jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies .	750.419209750974
 There were n't facilities to take care of them ; there never had been a need felt for such facilities .	175.24016232882536
 That kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight rates .	232.35331767276114
 The East was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay .	590.0105037919733
 The government offices were being opened but they were n't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything .	890.9624861682931
 Shivering , people talked and argued ; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate remedies and something had to be done .	393.4313589447554
 Something had to be done ; it was the theme song of millions of American people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government .	261.5612606342668
 Something had to be done .	102.47721920094179
 The Abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day .	222.24618079074588
 Something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half soles , for overshoes , for clothes , for the new leaks in the roof , for gas and light bills ; about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once , twice , fifty times a day .	300.40362306137354
 Just dropping the baby 's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster .	590.8259762020324
 The Abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold .	424.73198532772244
 Cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up , under doors , around loosened window frames , from the sleeping porches , the attic , from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof .	152.81619100865035
 Presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the fireplaces and an electric heater in Grandma 's room .	216.22530846606455
 It was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them , like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive .	222.03692995077944
 The pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms .	412.04536067174564
 They lived mainly in the kitchen ; they moved Maggie 's bed and the baby 's basket there , and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds .	235.54557121967056
 Grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to .	198.45487876442047
 You said a mouthful , Eugenia said grimly .	34.16834264299375
 Eugenia hated being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin .	546.2251914546589
 She said to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever .	105.49735819391135
 Plenty of people are poor all their lives .	251.85852020183867
 Plenty of people have n't our brains and talent .	360.66476072764715
 I know you when you start talking about brains and talent , Maggie said .	357.14110748234253
 You 're working up to something , and if you do n't watch out you 'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the Abernathy family is superior to everything , even a depression .	278.4643109094435
 The only thing that worries me is how I 'm going to prove it , Eugenia said .	219.06430230712786
 They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way .	238.36854967971342
 She did n't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater .	342.4480463982156
 Hope would n't hear of it , and she took the heater back to Grandma 's room , and Grandma took it back to Hope 's room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire .	141.0994908526735
 She said that proved she was n't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it .	189.0984045897621
 Eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma would n't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in .	411.2536989675743
 Thrifty of her to use it up .	98.60372781780572
 Unusual in a case like this , but- You can joke !	240.88952006511744
 Did n't you read it ?	373.85734168351263
 She 's married that tenant !	203.52304080341753
 I read it , yes .	89.79865535211214
 This ought to simplify Tolley 's life .	187.0247266491233
 Laban had more to say .	60.09622792179185
 Tolley had gone to live in California .	105.89750709533716
 He 'd mentioned it , himself , at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that Tolley had left because Jenny had jilted him for Roy robards .	138.05928764618474
 It was plain as the nose on your face that they 're laughing about it , Mamma .	315.9389397144194
 Zion stayed to get my pin , but it 'll be a cold day in June when I go back .	160.80358299078586
 We will both go back , Laban !	167.2683731389037
 Kizzie turned to go inside .	134.59100060379626
 Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , Mamma .	785.7286736066752
 The sun 's right- Pictures ?	60.355586009088576
 She swung around .	553.3694325048267
 What pictures ?	819.4908016261262
 In Brace 's room !	112.47084941762986
 You told me to bring my camera .	188.18553785074099
 I 'm not going back- Indeed you are !	500.264507935462
 Why should I want pictures of an empty room now ?	709.669788795845
 Tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little Jenny !	65.2891888375596
 This- trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants , and I am going to see that everybody at Mt Pleasant understands that simple fact .	167.3264424664948
 Wait for me , Laban , I 'll be dressed in half a second !	191.1701357441994
 Frank followed her into the bedroom , hooked her dress up the back .	301.5149139103317
 Hurry , Frank !	138.66440695914903
 They 're not going to laugh at the Fairbrothers and Labans very long !	137.21061760192606
 Tolley 's going is my fault .	254.23951768156599
 I drove him away .	114.35027340511809
 You know it and I 'll tell everybody exactly how it happened .	276.6175781549934
 She was so beautiful , so valiant , so pitiable .	67.94768651764318
 He kissed her .	40.14192367969692
 Make your confession to God , Kizzie dear , not to the congregation .	308.03522023049095
 I 'll decide that when I get there .	146.91288392584548
 I was so cruel to Tolley , so unfair .	125.80511450100221
 But I 'll be fair now !	190.0127143780571
 He is coming back , is n't he , Frank ?	175.65513587224825
 Yes , oh yes .	414.41408614966014
 What else was there to say ?	138.37495814664672
 Returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from Jonathan Swift on his lips Under the window in stormy weather I marry this man and woman together .	432.5900461366839
 Let none but Him who rules the thunder Put this man and woman asunder .	1213.3510543939037
 Absolution for his lie ?	214.17846868993664
 He questioned God 's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about Kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole , wondering why he had preserved it .	195.9353277877897
 If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it .	182.46600245656404
 In any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons , making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own .	339.43450674611194
 It was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing .	215.61634005820545
 You 've told God , Frank , he said .	162.42064185431838
 Why lacerate the- congregation ?	513.5093804264219
 Reaching for an old clay pot , relic of pioneer days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little pyre to flame , watching it curl , the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash .	344.88654969781226
 Surely now his beloved son could rest in peace .	600.2690705251027
 'And let me go , for the night gathers me , and in the night shall no man gather fruit ' .	247.28037436085845
 A beautiful and haunting line , a subtle genius , Swinburne , difficult not to envy a gifted man , and perhaps he did h. But there were great satisfactions , even for a small man .	178.01207268479814
 Beyond his window were the greening trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal life .	419.056224803079
 There lay Grand Fair 's Quinzaine , his own young parents ' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , grandsons .	251.28377100062661
 He poured his thimble of wine for the toast he 'd made so often .	266.8473929009779
 To absent loved ones .	2553.633096601137
 But this last time he drank not to Brace but To Tolley !	195.52502722937282
 42 MR ROBARDS- Jenny was the only person she knew of in the Mt Pleasant neighborhood who called him that- was kind but too easygoing .	349.40563299867534
 It did n't bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say , Howdy , Miss Jenny , adding a careless Roy , but it did her .	106.68569955915007
 He could put a stop to it , she told him again and again .	96.89580106216751
 Simply call Mr Whipsnade Oscar , and Dr Dunne PG , and C'un Major Frank .	154.7671768201466
 Mr Robards laughed , said he 'd feel a damn fool , plain-out could n't do that even to please her .	253.50281353384779
 You could try .	158.1655876877482
 And if I ever hear you say 'Mist Laban ' again I 'll scream .	281.45052444982616
 And do n't tell me you did n't at church Sunday .	300.62444489835985
 I heard you !	141.85230459323287
 He really had n't meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr Robards .	135.0582959700966
 How strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in- spiritual ways .	314.7770188345479
 Another weakness- far more irritating than his manner of speaking , which he made only token effort to change- was his devotion to that old horse of Tolley 's .	264.5936002441868
 Her horse , rather .	411.7999540742141
 But Mr Robards ' now , oh my yes , indeed , yes !	380.48767541451826
 He called her the Mare much as Mrs Whipsnade spoke of the Queen , God bless her .	298.0733791692206
 h He , with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there in the barn , was reverent only of the Mare , the Racin ' Mare , the revolting Gunny .	78.86363184855901
 For the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny , going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall .	237.09558504854726
 And what had happened ?	118.97425511091528
 Gunny invariably tried to bite her .	418.4230722246566
 Nerves , Mr Robards said , just a nip anyway .	60.494668138489196
 Stand back , Miss Jen , she 's oneasy of your scarf .	45.37279377156253
 Never , Quit that , you sor'l devil !	297.81248852529404
 Never concern for his wife 's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January .	608.2853921084495
 She mus n't annoy Gunny whose foal was due then too !	194.21800563875766
 Listening for hours to his laments that the war and Mist Fair 's poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph , and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come , Jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it .	304.19203892977924
 Gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant- Tolley , the indifference with which the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her disgusting swollen stomach .	256.57573319555223
 Human birth was no novelty to Mr Robards .	429.21604415055185
 Tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick , he suggested .	121.33889432204195
 Jenny 's aversion to having Dr Dunne , a former admirer , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her .	246.01520860475367
 The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure .	267.346021808955
 He would be in the barn , or riding for the veterinarian !	76.96147961058871
 Night after night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter , rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment , fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe , tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house .	190.12580831901843
 Yet when the dear baby came , he had Tillie over here in a jiffy , and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been .	136.91912453827572
 Jenny wished now that she had had Dr Dunne , feeling that somehow he would n't have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets .	203.36762203994508
 There was something not nice about triplets , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they had n't been the son he wanted , saying , You do n't see triplets trippin ' down the pike ever ' day , Miss Jen , hon .	162.8514650970539
 Rhyme 'em up cute- Arcilla , Flotilla h Edmonia for her mother , she said firmly , Jennifer , for herself , and- Kezziah , for Miss Kizzie , he suggested .	87.21443278536594
 She was mighty good to you past times , an ' this 'll fetch her .	655.1269249475118
 Now she must be thinking of a boy-name , something special .	106.61780882389722
 Just wait till she saw the Mare 's foal .	185.89418395005728
 Handsomest colt in all Kentucky .	391.7375192385161
 Strong too , up on his legs when he was an hour old .	276.6618375341471
 What about Royal Robards ?	536.8658729557687
 Why do n't you name him Jesus Christ !	915.2769006932533
 She burst into tears .	859.6802351138858
 Roy was deeply distressed .	324.32716298103907
 He 'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been .	274.7255237885205
 Of course she was n't herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits did n't seem to rise with it .	321.400004099907
 He had a good idea why not .	171.2619351807319
 Those elegant At Home cards she sent out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all trimmed up , had n't brought many callers in two whole months .	476.5369586319648
 Doc Dunne and Miss Sis had come .	37.26322016278944
 So had Miss Shawnee Rakestraw , full of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his Heavenly Rest last year , saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town in inclement weather , was looking forward to Quinzaine Spa this summer .	326.8578320869542
 There was an idea .	51.85128694919451
 Miss Kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married , though you 'd have thought a namesake would have brought her round .	183.94331974282
 Oh , she 'd come to see them once , left silver teething rings for all of the trips .	128.02377944047154
 But when Miss Jen went over right away to return the call , Miss Kiz could n't have been very cordial , for she 'd come back before she hardly had time to get there .	227.7889131675563
 More and more , these days , she 'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to Tillie 's and Nick's- his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and pups under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies .	417.46757912390814
 Though he was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too .	207.04918849745036
 It made him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea Miss Sis had given him , to be told by Miss Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain Mrs Robards and the children .	203.65861558157053
 She hoped they were well .	237.68306389346515
 He did n't tell Miss Jen , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those Quinzaine nigs , and she really took a fit .	159.3303448191388
 If he ever did such a thing again she 'd die of shame .	393.7708095463843
 Have a party an ' leave 'em out , hon , he suggested .	418.95625035746565
 A swell party , send an invite to ever'body but them- those folks you met at the Galt House , the ones I 've got to know in this new Jockey Club affair , the whole dang neighborhood .	320.5358105311353
 We 'll have oystchers- couple bar'l oystchers 'll fetch in a crowd any time .	216.82676236122205
 I 'll see word gets round .	691.9525194372603
 Do n't you dare !	531.9001567948785
 Miss Jen was funny that way , funny that she did n't seem to take to his ideas and perk up .	148.9741012319142
 He was downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try h. Zion was surprised when Roy 's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town .	435.0189509737558
 Roy smiled- he did have a nice smile- took off his hat most politely , told her to hop in , and he 'd give her a lift to Quinzaine .	226.63329453760744
 Her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he did n't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on .	364.8882466596395
 See for yourself , Miss Zion .	315.0883583579151
 It wo n't take a minute .	129.508565553421
 He swung in through his own wide gateway .	154.21724036546138
 Them 's the purtiest babes you ever did see , but Miss Jen gets mighty lonesome .	143.44964024663386
 She 'll relish the sight of a friendly face .	332.6646293986615
 Miss Kiz wo n't care your comin ' , will she ?	375.2502839453596
 Why of course not , Zion said uncomfortably .	119.7392559500436
 He must have forgiven me , Henrietta murmured to the room .	281.35070496373726
 The absolution of Doaty 's last will and testament was proof enough of that ; Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman .	183.5171425295037
 She found herself wishing an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin .	326.8396343378172
 Perhaps Doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel .	266.37517577002916
 Henrietta thought , It 's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us .	498.5132182017695
 There had been more to know about Hetty , inevitably , and most of it unfavorable .	58.34830676947176
 Adelia was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted .	145.8799105610061
 Their childhood would have been quite circumspect without Hetty 's flair for drama , especially through the long summers .	266.07595278802864
 In winter , in the city , there had been the Maneret School , which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge ; there had been lessons in French from a small Polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; there had been the dancing class- Miss Craddock , thin and tireless , with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three , one-two-three .	163.4073744925318
 There had been supper parties and teas , fetes and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the Blackwell planets revolved .	264.75747498964756
 Mama had died before the corruption of the family circle , the interruption of Charles .	295.6524233358831
 It was safe to assume that Papa , sighing heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , Thank God your poor mother was spared this , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in Charles ' hand , just because her poor mother was gone already and would never know .	275.6356875412813
 Mama was vulnerable ; one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her .	259.2236622233965
 But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta .	322.66478849521985
 She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .	108.36477437823527
 Only at this moment- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty 's bed- she found herself examining how others might regard her .	444.6252368707575
 Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice .	386.9868900553224
 She turned on her side , finding the idea oppressive .	153.15151064309325
 If Adelia had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run away with him ?	351.56836293681675
 Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone .	261.56202785700947
 No temptation , no sin .	399.67554421725646
 No temptation , no virtue ?	622.9154232808726
 A curious thought to end a curious night .	507.16605514448383
 The birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all of Doaty 's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf .	303.2894780889235
 Before anything else , she would go to Doaty 's grave with flowers from Doaty 's forgotten garden .	272.26782478011165
 Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards .	652.6883922018845
 She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls .	966.260565647593
 It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray .	146.3453292808929
 After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .	295.4414714364079
 The garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness .	137.02763730271616
 Leaning out , she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it .	116.14154670814139
 On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song .	343.31562591274985
 It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age .	219.2760654327281
 Feeling suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs .	354.48623955931106
 Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human .	100.9739148788078
 Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .	345.42647484746743
 Outside , the garden , the tame wilderness , yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies , sweet william , scented stock and lady 's bedstraw , which she tied with long grasses and took back to show Rosa , who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing Folly .	100.74327002419717
 The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws .	58.73530066921303
 Henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for Doaty .	150.1872667714685
 Rummaging in the dew , said Rosa coldly .	18.689674952869836
 Go change your shoes before you turn around .	1593.8212127288666
 She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home .	700.4096968790802
 Folly danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door .	472.501376925115
 To a Blackwell , there was only one church .	52.56903688629425
 The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea .	140.04926953282876
 For the first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity .	330.12171137470506
 She smiled and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child .	322.9654910747298
 Now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested .	110.4077009991354
 An old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than reflective look as she passed , the sap still plainly rising in his branches .	292.2039130357141
 On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning .	266.6253026164477
 He cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition , announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time .	133.00721064166186
 He then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was unenthusiastic .	84.5656156661941
 Summer 's been slow to come , he said .	124.28436465165238
 It 's my dryin ' out time .	173.38379352631483
 He scowled at her flowers .	83.55190937146891
 I 'm taking them to the cemetery , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality .	241.97981337821466
 They 'll be takin ' me next , he said pleasantly , but not so soon 's they plan .	272.2616802782064
 See half of 'em in their graves before I choose my own coffin .	261.9061155820269
 It 's dryin ' myself out that does it .	201.50710890276142
 He regarded her with rising hope .	444.5271417667361
 You 'd like to hear how I go about it .	163.85788226500185
 It 's nice of you , Henrietta said doubtfully .	226.74669042995436
 Y 're welcome .	1944.94394981739
 He straightened himself , soldierly against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots .	322.6514915636995
 His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text .	170.9742485336486
 Every month , f'r three days , he said happily , I take no water into my system , no water whatsoever .	169.90688756038864
 It rests the tissues .	374.1134246084305
 Henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense .	370.65984171796043
 Rests the tissues , he said , and pacifies the system .	42.144133858481
 My dad did it , and he lived to a great age .	64.85087114669864
 He looked up at her sharply .	118.56754874544461
 Do n't remember , do you ?	323.31261646807343
 She did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old Titus , who must have been in his nineties when Henrietta ran away .	118.73210838168796
 Next to the Blackwells , Titus had owned the island most , and she and Adelia had often stood in front of him , silenced by his terrible years- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner , more aged than possible .	194.7484026380338
 He had never spoken once to the awed sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea .	179.29721048623009
 It must be that son who sat before her now , shriveled to half his size and half his senses .	217.59333592078508
 She said gently , Of course I remember you .	622.107849578828
 Not so well 's I remember you , he said .	191.97299128478738
 Y 're the young Blackwell woman .	439.85396213309104
 Ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man .	74.71962548149472
 I know all about you .	98.392501851312
 You do seem to , said Henrietta , impressed .	414.1808076685593
 Ca n't blame a man for leavin ' his wife , he said quite cheerfully .	154.82041385570102
 Left mine many a time , only she never knew it .	370.79495330242605
 Man in a boat , there 's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit .	180.9713429980761
 Any harm in that ?	786.3235408950668
 Probably , said Henrietta dryly .	284.20442920262946
 He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly .	193.8198265348729
 You 'd be the one to say , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were different , since all actions had their own laws .	335.9761363703037
 Only , this old man 's connivance was even less to her taste than Selma Cotter 's open censure .	142.01622075462902
 Well , she had not come back to Great Island to be understood , praised or condemned .	227.78276798387395
 She had come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow .	110.04047118787135
 She started to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a big-boned , drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress .	190.87117930634915
 She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man .	475.64337904538627
 You 've not had your breakfast yet , gran'dad .	323.38392229823296
 Y'r dam ' porridge is no breakfast , he said .	151.23534507075698
 Milk and sops !	466.0486303134379
 He beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones .	84.33691264997084
 He 's owly today , his grand-daughter said wearily , and bent to pick it up .	78.54320452952395
 He 's got this idea about drying out h It ai n't an idea !	627.5149462081959
 If it ai n't an idea , she said , how comes it you can drink beer but not water ?	433.1423428516952
 He looked piously to heaven and said , Beer do n't affect the tissues none , and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence .	307.7956099520887
 His grand-daughter sighed .	169.22103462186374
 Come on , do .	1420.9395647196236
 The children are eating , and Miss Blackwell 's on her way somewheres .	128.94662184037958
 To the graveyard .	237.7820000614289
 Who ai n't ?	1782.5489986176817
 Not me .	167.43063484757653
 I 've got a day 's work to do.- You 'll be visiting Miss Doaty , ma'am ?	173.91774955655453
 Henrietta nodded .	2241.6522354601602
 How much they knew about her !	351.6561829271901
 The woman she must have been a tiny baby when Hetty and Delia had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small answered the nod with her own .	668.0356446232838
 God rest her soul , she was a sweet one .	407.60077648848585
 Come on now .	1005.366495046444
 She put a strong hand under the old man 's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old .	366.2667153019632
 He mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength .	295.8887503854002
 There was a gabble of voices from indoors , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of swearing from the old man .	300.55699798531595
 Henrietta looked down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on their journey 's way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , Folly dancing ahead of her .	266.0196645823145
 At the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , dotted with fat round bushes like sheep .	456.84448286465744
 They were covered with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots clawing at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry .	260.97159535462185
 The air was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky .	237.65494126913242
 She felt mindless , walking , and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty .	261.0454076769319
 Both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them how many things had lessened while she was gone away but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named Dorothy Tredding seemed suddenly impossible .	478.52996168251434
 She sat down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with sea-damp , her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss .	382.0377542127017
 The day 's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her parasol , if only to shade Doaty 's flowers .	251.26811872501017
 A small , rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery .	419.1547469424682
 She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts .	300.73709984572355
 The Momoyama family had come from Miyagi Prefecture , in the northeast of the main Japanese island of Honshu , where there are still traces of the mysterious Ainu strain .	121.06049273247571
 The Ainus were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal ancestors of the Japanese came from Southern Asia .	196.0575485749505
 Apparently they were of Caucasian blood .	142.0102915687104
 They had white skins and blue eyes ; all their men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful .	425.3121395036862
 A pitiful few of them are left now , to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants , which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the American Indians .	139.12553414858684
 Most of them have been assimilated , but sometimes a man in Miyagi or Akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average Japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the South .	130.68341317497152
 Tommy Momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions .	440.9078876882526
 She was taller than most Japanese girls , and had the exquisitely willowy form of the Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall .	179.3258031821756
 Her nose was higher of bridge , her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn , and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong .	322.4977361022328
 Her mouth , soft and full , was something for any man to dream about .	405.42742996950255
 She had black eyes , long and intriguingly tilted , and the way she walked was melody .	302.13008020874753
 She had been in Japan just one week .	249.59830490340045
 It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at San Diego , Bremerton , the Great Lakes , Pensacola- any place the Navy had a hospital- with a threat to resign her commission if the	266.2522355468986
285.60263978426696
