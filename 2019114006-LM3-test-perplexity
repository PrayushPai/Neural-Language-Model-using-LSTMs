 You mean dream ?	3596.3837928918206
 Not exactly .	784.4381813382228
 Just see it .	232.45894577631665
 Benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble .	389.1475865443877
 Nope , just you , all the time- sometimes I think it 's the only way I 'll ever get a decent partner .	460.8616765229211
 Ramey smiled but he thought to himself , I always see me too .	271.0989312750332
 Never Benny .	157.3845390618274
 Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt , Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind .	389.3122629268619
 Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think .	298.2172986806845
 With this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down .	165.09024301255735
 You seen him yet ?	664.8365976034478
 Benson said , referring to the Indian .	113.59863309528232
 He was n't in the car , Ramey said .	42.66416723779854
 You did n't go clear around , Benson said .	198.1708248452651
 If you want to see something , he 's back on the other side by the trunk of the car .	86.26595858613057
 Too long a waiting line , Ramey answered , pretending to joke .	699.9008895283075
 A few minutes later the insurance man , a road checker , drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state .	218.4240614728913
 It was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed .	682.0761105045356
 Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed .	308.6301543941859
 All the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges , the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane .	787.8942600955141
 Horsely , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist .	273.95375373503776
 It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist , an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head .	291.2124437325609
 The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men 's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town .	278.7326746362132
 He chatted with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer .	84.12873756011605
 Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear .	374.99657139826843
 When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer .	177.01107287894328
 There 's a body you wo n't mind looking at , Benson said and they stopped .	439.3308908465197
 She had driven up with her husband in a convertible with Eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that .	657.2714666148847
 She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt .	354.8875369174109
 Slender and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply .	360.1872217487905
 What outfit does she drive for ?	2920.3278533627163
 Benson said .	35.78152716568973
 Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey , a recognition .	149.9798709056718
 She might have been someone he had once loved .	407.3868963972055
 He had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run .	126.54647431880393
 The truck routes , the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay .	538.7633522009829
 How would you ever see her again ?	507.22185034873394
 The feeling subsided , it was only a small yearning .	116.74043845117056
 Their work was lonely .	401.03851334468453
 What 's she doing in this bunch ?	548.320968540943
 Benson said , and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been .	277.97443609614834
 The girl looked around at the countryside .	260.73001787818185
 Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing .	1848.570908941451
 It made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on .	365.92523814280776
 She began to watch a blonde-haired man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly .	224.35658515286008
 What had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but Benson knew what it was .	389.65684288045617
 The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson , in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real , said , You do n't want to go around there , Ma'am .	224.7093689781041
 The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her .	655.8573105598551
 The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car .	416.3979150719496
 The two drivers moved closer .	1099.0270530249188
 What does he want , a spoon ?	260.2541178885513
 Benson said to Ramey .	24.964271063909237
 One tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain .	308.9572802312354
 With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian 's foot that he would always remember .	314.13628547393165
 The laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top .	90.35404772326478
 The slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside .	281.34382545909756
 The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man .	118.11747710550442
 He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows .	239.80454176112283
 He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes .	297.41529337107363
 He was very tanned- big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster .	122.86656246439097
 He 's dead , is n't he ?	134.3652575936269
 the man said .	197.86896176052193
 He turned and bent over the body of the Indian .	142.76292865310234
 There was nothing in particular on the man 's face .	124.95499199133793
 It was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine .	191.0199132330545
 What 's this ?	411.3395197126442
 the man said , backing up a step , still looking down .	374.6327490595943
 His words were mostly to himself .	291.9912303944065
 Do n't .	430.000903717712
 There was a gentle concern in Benson 's voice .	121.99908871310147
 Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man 's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded , blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement .	183.58196087101226
 But what is it ?	113.32375682872349
 the man said with a tone of impatience .	292.47976288306177
 But what is it ?	113.43353410799006
 The man had spoken only once .	285.8851373252759
 Ramey heard the words again inside , weakened , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears .	318.5086455180827
 The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey 's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man 's leg .	213.81221903347875
 Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin .	915.8396125552815
 He stared at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , Do n't do that , fella .	388.4828777398723
 Them 's brains .	200.57252199666448
 The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist .	388.13136483583185
 Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth .	209.0739979421838
 It was a straight , solid , once-in-a-lifetime shot ; he laid all four knuckles in between the man 's cheekbone and his chin .	260.7585626351985
 Ramey 's fist and the air expelled from the man 's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together .	262.9921076311733
 The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement .	481.1653374410107
 Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand .	320.187202225223
 As he watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet .	481.9592376058157
 He had n't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard .	440.862682197766
 With a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him .	199.99174635593153
 His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open .	310.4273018319937
 After what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it .	775.3698566373769
 The man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth .	369.59493087497555
 He moaned and pulled the hand away .	131.351809505903
 Even yet there was no realization in his eyes .	222.17084820559663
 Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him .	476.57902231032745
 He did not look around .	107.0880377008689
 What happened ?	481.6334753317962
 someone said .	526.3653228657903
 He 's hurt !	378.207238776305
 A woman 's voice said , and then he heard a sort of wail from the man 's wife .	112.96775708526204
 The man on the ground began to move ; one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him .	157.34052513275316
 Blood dripped down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright V woven into the neckline had melted , running a darker color .	336.8849930889009
 The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back .	238.1262233855399
 Can you hear , can you talk to me ?	485.1261732104913
 she begged .	128.30297244749715
 An incoherent , puzzled sound came from the red mouth .	362.72122326554995
 The girl looked around quickly at several of the people .	268.3622975539065
 None of the crowd had stepped forward to help .	540.8900544007295
 Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment .	86.14919280875395
 Why did you do it- why did you hit him ?	876.7747516389067
 she said , her voice rising .	505.6238840893312
 Ramey said nothing .	118.63072400606457
 A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again .	457.81710062867273
 Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers .	1073.1829566245497
 No one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out .	409.8920831714711
 Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman .	225.40338837470168
 Benson moved his arms , gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly .	489.5573173967624
 Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man .	202.0383092185645
 Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey .	90.84731801672018
 It 's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them .	329.2103631853324
 Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer .	224.3204187081074
 He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman 's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol .	229.43969310955424
 All right , step back !	707.8009609503882
 the patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis .	251.59060716079128
 He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him .	232.30790000027096
 You all right ?	618.1586110649797
 Mough- it 's my mough , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips .	198.0513997015521
 His brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it .	588.5735448053239
 Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head- caught in the wicker back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute .	193.68601228494168
 The body continued to lash , but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome , bloody mass out of the bungalow .	92.96594722521925
 He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots .	138.64337567279316
 He heard their chattering , and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes .	201.77563920515195
 It was only then that he turned to look at Penny .	81.53772807800307
 She was sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her .	165.25496620381426
 The fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth .	226.23210000646037
 But her hands were calm , now .	247.36123007721653
 She 's got guts , thought Keith .	100.0835999576453
 She 's got more guts than any other woman in the world .	168.1831528582284
 Keith , said Penny , Keith , you were wonderful .	56.54024413017884
 I do n't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am .	437.7997927203486
 Thank you , Keith .	27.978691670689475
 He smiled at her sincerity .	394.5269431329038
 And for the hundredth time that week , he was startled at her beauty .	79.884084828745
 Strange .	28.833370787149192
 Seven years they 'd been married .	1467.3454076070745
 He knew her mind pretty well , by now , its quick perceptions and sympathies , its painful insistence on truth and directness , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate , even in part .	426.72881519225257
 But her beauty always surprised him anew .	1350.3418757562797
 I realize that this is hardly the time to say it , Penny , said Keith .	109.81408019247989
 But knowing you , I know that you 're glad to be alive , and grateful- and sorry because I killed the snake , even though I had to .	308.99338192813815
 Is n't that so ?	374.04153774449156
 Penny lowered her eyes .	383.09863178511665
 Yes , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime .	151.00229649027986
 The snake was beautiful , was n't it ?	227.36968117111854
 asked Keith , his voice getting harsher in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger .	332.15907239090615
 It was a king cobra , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , did n't it ?	140.10260565021537
 DID N'T IT ?	1824.5020684416425
 Penny did not answer .	80.96041906874343
 Now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him .	456.02986997299007
 We 're all God 's creatures , are n't we ?	550.015244965121
 Keith was snarling now .	24.88671119387026
 All of us- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle .	83.95124011179385
 You love this village and these stinking brown people because they 're God 's creatures , too .	793.6274424124174
 And you love Ahmiri , that black bastard of a servant even a little more , because he 's a beautiful man .	353.49049621288384
 And he loves you because you 're a beautiful woman .	560.3865944551582
 We 're all God 's creatures , are n't we , Penny ?	318.35548244013677
 All of us , that is , except me .	149.3045632120025
 You hate me , you hate my guts , because I like to hunt .	379.19871966265674
 You actually hate me- and we both know it- because I killed that filthy snake .	1417.3076878175802
 h Well , why do n't you say something ?	945.428491409635
 Penny would not rise to his mood .	110.75082302904943
 There is n't anything left to say , is there , Keith ?	130.53550790182348
 She softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader .	308.6328320471093
 He knew she was not sulking , not even angry at him .	116.0476842594442
 Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him .	369.3005638981821
 The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world , the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet .	80.22455966919044
 For a brief period each year , the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls , and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon , and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long , meandering journey to the sea- running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga , then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam , past the Khasi Hills , and into Bengal , past Sirinjani and Madaripur , until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal .	201.16992990073166
 Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space .	395.1815313966771
 But Keith looked down more than up .	157.62635076425855
 He thought of the jungles below him , and of the wild , strange , untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the lords .	183.9136729016853
 At first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war .	280.7608776964163
 But after the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself .	207.12751671537998
 Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves .	224.65649175239415
 And Keith 's record of kills made him a man to listen to- a man paradoxically , who might even survive .	430.776940599249
 He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates .	177.58529553832636
 The RAF was Britain 's weapon of attrition , and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war .	375.73210598408315
 He knew how to shoot down Nazis .	776.4373998252321
 And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it- because he was chemically incapable of fear .	258.9611224430976
 That was true , but only half the truth .	121.12668542775205
 The other half he did n't like to recognize , even to himself .	234.57839544403754
 He enjoyed the killing .	295.66483090990863
 Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity .	773.3259576283032
 He enjoyed killing .	905.27600796325
 And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi .	207.80780055512474
 Nowadays , we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish .	87.28942022224574
 The Nazis bombed Britain , so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down .	133.70684149337598
 Not quite .	770.3579792653136
 It was a war of nerves , of stamina , of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis , who were better organized and technically superior .	320.2902214914916
 It took a long time before the British tipped the balance .	150.98649877369087
 Keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be risked .	251.35584605844494
 They grounded him over his protests- not including his true reason for wanting to fly and put him in the Command offices .	313.9952850885863
 That was where he met Penny .	95.48248834074866
 He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , regardless of how important she might have thought she was in the Command offices , but that was all .	241.82343049356786
 Penny knew him better , on her part .	132.1382513181003
 He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals .	145.38637752485394
 They do n't go for bull-like muscle , as a rule .	179.783974657605
 He had strength in his six-foot frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier .	60.268963712255875
 He was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep .	84.7753861907234
 His hair was black , already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom , the only one permitted to a man .	97.13537950864232
 The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles- and Penny , hating the cliche , had to admit that in this case it applied .	120.28811586322223
 Keith was an eagle .	16.97775769265666
 Penny and Keith had no romance .	93.69897909023581
 No dates or hand-holding .	137.54651422225524
 But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly .	325.1058773706678
 The Command offices were in the border country , up north , where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports , and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy .	492.3998557176523
 The Nazis knew this , of course , and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit .	357.84424442648645
 This time , they had been lucky .	129.10023547655248
 The Command post was underground , and well camouflaged .	278.4173963742651
 But there had n't been enough time to build it for keeps .	309.5281268399936
 There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as efficacious , when a direct hit comes along .	485.3919019028022
 This one was actually more of a near miss .	300.63808483101815
 The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post , but not precisely into the Command room itself .	406.42630778752135
 There was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks , as ordered .	208.43242890884494
 That is , everyone but Keith and Penny .	66.15780856026478
 They stood there , just the two of them , in the rocking , shattering blast .	123.4503732789165
 Keith was on his feet because he did n't care at all about life any more Penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much .	357.44483898782875
 The bomb was a solitary one .	225.28574670018023
 The blast damaged , but did not destroy the room .	330.84105476779496
 Keith 's eyes met Penny 's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction .	468.0056845224868
 And , as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his .	226.67011389181235
 The chaplain married them , on the next day .	83.57655870802846
 After the war , Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her .	196.11612554948
 She came from Ohio , from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres , as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers .	344.5988105944116
 But to Keith 's London-bred mind , such acreage sounded rather invincible .	267.01880390481296
 It was n't that , however , which decided them not to go to America .	127.43965663761361
 Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma .	223.97938178981016
 He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles .	91.40555606519702
 He did n't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself .	447.03366406513044
 He could n't stop killing .	402.50983302349067
 That was his true love , not Penny .	91.06648539549815
 The terrible power of a gun , the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose .	186.71179586808967
 And in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing .	229.5073492092486
 When they got to Shillong , in Assam , he was happy .	58.98563443662574
 This is a paradise for hunters .	101.36267203964316
 This was the land of the sladang , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread .	276.22545205376116
 The great black leopards .	99.13941626744385
 The sambur buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk .	73.43092650657965
 He even hunted elephant , although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin .	481.68872625308586
 But there are big rogues in both countries .	170.8834543020014
 These were the ones Keith sought out- the loners , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself .	218.46835683120122
 He and Penny would go out on tame elephants , raised from babyhood in the keddah .	76.91450158559793
 And while he was ever alert for game , and most particularly a tiger , Penny marvelled at the Eden they were traversing .	230.37605882980182
 They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools .	325.90396275602484
 Peacocks strutted across their path , preening .	76.00147019488567
 There were fantastic flowers without perfume , and gaudy birds without song .	712.6455535486946
 Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close .	478.7948359552592
 Wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted derision when they did n't consider such game worthy of a shot from the .404 's .	211.75116618435268
 Now , the next morning , they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms , with the weighted line beside it ; and Robinson Roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface .	343.8418534443293
 He and his safety man , Herr Schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together .	134.84613055653963
 The German courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first .	812.3982760863374
 Robinson clambered heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his triple-tank assembly .	496.2732232914409
 He was frowning .	9.587964022942554
 He took his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck .	216.89730373635135
 Temper , temper , Mrs Forsythe said , laughing uneasily .	168.37209537150528
 A phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty , but irreparably stringy in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and tonic , though it was not yet ten AM I loused it , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice .	315.592901932003
 All I have to do to set the record is to go on down .	206.08356987842652
 So instead I come up .	401.63971467261416
 Was it my equipment ?	1143.563139777786
 the German asked .	699.6410374204352
 Was it something went bad with the breathing ?	900.3807168590378
 The equipment was fine , Rob stated , standing up .	399.69068738573975
 He was a huge young man of twenty-four , clothed in muscle , immensely strong , with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation .	229.46742269850142
 He stared stonily at the floor .	75.90783255127178
 I was down to 275 .	37.43248735344838
 I 've been that far half a dozen times .	543.3849932797577
 I do n't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick .	835.5484233894249
 Well , I get it , Artie said , still on the ladder .	103.92707368883418
 You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record .	287.57005677587273
 And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself .	428.69141497819186
 So you turn around .	495.54526512532505
 No , it was n't that , Rob said .	154.59322277474052
 A note of awe came into his voice .	363.23799163486353
 When I came up , damnit , I thought I was going down .	97.83762491490367
 I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening .	770.0609240614937
 Pressure-happy , Artie said , and climbed in .	70.48905004560213
 That 's right , Robinson said .	194.89970313152986
 I was expecting it , sure .	241.2884403120861
 But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you 're a hundred feet from where you thought you were- well , it makes you think .	289.04863799181084
 You do n't head back down again .	349.52566660794326
 Not me , anyway .	355.29747618307084
 Not right away .	392.25015922900906
 He had his voice under control again no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him .	318.2119968248304
 Waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat .	95.01686656735515
 Now he was going to show how much he knew .	230.5572243196061
 Our boy did n't chicken out , no sir .	509.51807248567457
 He ran into the rapture of the depths .	47.22286222105495
 Nitrogen narcosis .	14.547047070723
 It makes the diver feel drunk .	250.0576511406676
 Well , that 's the only way to be , Mrs Forsythe said , and gave her brassy laugh .	140.93872391712466
 Maybe not , if you 're 200 feet under water , Artie said .	489.99150782549776
 Anyway , Waddell went on .	70.9253997266582
 it 's nothing to fool with .	736.5282312173833
 It can kill you .	255.85567179126778
 Personally , I do n't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story .	264.57423513333026
 Nobody 's giving anything up , Robinson said .	624.8144035302663
 He stood there , towering over them all gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; and yet like a child among adults .	329.070562012845
 You think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ?	430.4808359412431
 I 'm going down again .	306.67770594038313
 That 's my boy !	478.3003331408444
 Mr Forsythe exclaimed .	364.86238089061857
 Rob 's not going to give up as easy as all that .	449.45460338787035
 He was a florid , puffy man in his early sixties , very natty in his yachting cap , striped jacket and white flannels .	96.86167202167735
 He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of Commodore was never used without irony .	373.03494099126135
 Old Commodore Forsythe , who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first .	679.9938807175831
 Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again Rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride .	230.16263662018082
 Why , he went on , when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I did n't think twice about it .	242.79076359613654
 I 've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother 's tackle shop .	998.257664773663
 Hell , I gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven- how many years ago was it , Rob ?	327.9056020445525
 Seven years ago , Commodore , Rob said impassively .	276.5259141230853
 He was thinking , big deal skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started .	393.78279291335355
 Excuse me , he said abruptly .	145.88164936799492
 He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters ; went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him .	222.05489101109433
 When you got ta go , you got ta go , Mrs Forsythe said .	170.6123680666483
 Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge .	496.36160171433727
 He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley .	163.83463868561594
 Hi there , Schaffner , he had said .	25.47727623206939
 Can I make you one ?	516.649933064084
 No thank you very much , Schaffner had answered in his accented English .	249.01593439367997
 I do not drink so much , thank you .	370.0204505949021
 Waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up .	149.39848696957625
 He was in his early forties , rather short and very compactly built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways .	270.5246627201598
 His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence .	402.85167060025105
 Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel 's Afrika Corps , and he said to himself I 'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night .	121.92271876479991
 Aloud he had said , making conversation Rob tells me he 's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive .	322.9245394036566
 Yes , Herr Schaffner had said .	318.7834454925851
 He 's one hell of a decent boy .	241.50670631099
 I like that kid .	396.55835720270125
 I agree , yes .	224.01931688709573
 And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right ?	292.05239760469635
 Well , no , Herr Schaffner said .	278.82205567985955
 Waddell turned to face him .	97.73336970392033
 No ?	425.3878305312683
 he asked .	314.02826974297665
 But that 's what he told me .	200.61387539598084
 Why , that 's his main reason for making the dive .	140.04658290860942
 Shaffner looked at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands .	194.6392122170622
 What do you mean ?	490.76838630790496
 Waddell asked , frowning .	34.83166467562845
 Please let me explain , the German said earnestly , his face still devoid of deceit .	390.1729030398477
 I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year .	587.9360607857976
 Now I wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong .	280.0224191728034
 I must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products .	389.09553702835746
 With all respect to a fine young man , Mr Roy is not able to provide these necessaries .	251.91088131476008
 Waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard .	102.12637719922142
 Did you tell him all this ?	927.7375055772214
 he asked .	302.1925908844877
 Perhaps not in so many words , the German said .	256.89079115603386
 But surely you have misunderstood Mr Roy .	436.6435095109733
 Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights .	455.57397367661935
 We spoke of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity .	232.0275861111145
 He was most eager to make the dive ; of course , I was willing .	101.31285145755669
 But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements .	530.7655247842373
 Well , damn , Waddell said .	181.94273387505618
 There was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline .	59.60421730937014
 He started out the door .	136.34769701353886
 One moment !	1073.0606152579066
 Herr Schaffner said .	315.0537111109731
 You intend to speak with Mr Roy ?	986.1517904780229
 What else ?	536.7140004759378
 Waddell asked .	71.57691621747168
 If you will pardon , I think it would be better if not .	153.7777087538184
 Mr Roy is determined to make this dive .	199.43559394821352
 Whatever you tell him he will dive .	193.50739176560205
 I know this from my talks with him .	285.6833963688181
 Well , let 's let him make up his own mind , OK ?	311.5813185107819
 Waddell said .	36.81317541440715
 On the basis of the facts .	53.330616451139996
 You will make him unhappy and anxious , the German said .	379.15846764283674
 At 200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him .	384.3104620226322
 It is not good , Mr Waddell you will do him great harm .	235.3766284710685
 There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said .	344.8704760577319
 Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .	155.23586411452536
 I am an honest man , the German said with fervor .	177.88546991932853
 I will give Mr Roy his due for this dive .	312.5191491138509
 I will make him distributor for all of Florida- a big market .	285.0242602367183
 All tourists come to Florida .	870.2475999125602
 This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop .	297.7355969993291
 Yes !	1636.7952264120133
 But there is no use causing him to worry at this time .	260.18178529337564
 The German 's words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty .	208.6368673894918
 He took a big swig of his drink .	91.21824932061433
 It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this .	229.3146757255904
 I think maybe you 're right , Schaffner , he said .	220.6122387227122
 He has the distributorship for Florida , you say ?	130.65833260805226
 Yes , the German said .	174.38573296781533
 At least for South Florida .	876.3522360717996
 By God , Waddell said , we do n't want to upset the boy at this time of all times .	175.08385842874367
 I guess you 're right .	839.2696493140903
 He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps .	82.61222615741333
 The story was shaping up nicely in his mind the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America .	373.19579861589494
 Join me in another ?	1279.5927000389124
 he had asked .	170.9274889608113
 Thank you , the German had said courteously .	76.22666541323079
 I do not drink so much .	286.8869894668646
 Now , in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk .	825.4363608096422
 Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions .	301.9837565485052
 He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper .	269.02389841568623
 Blessed Saint Nicholas , I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered .	457.3056886284955
 And when I make the dive again- He paused ; crossed himself ; said a Hail Mary , slowly and with understanding .	730.6044377325508
 Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to Headquarters .	408.8394345798031
 Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive .	393.5160126313486
 Make it come off all right .	852.5683829065924
 Let me set the record this time , and let me get back OK , so the German will give me the exclusive .	374.36926075539134
 And make my life different and better from this time on .	464.2951115653445
 Amen .	2918.7007307634094
 He crossed himself again and rose .	291.5093458801025
 He felt a good deal less shaky .	142.33486572380906
 As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk .	211.30602730914742
 Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger .	59.505735539653095
 He waited awhile before he said , Roy , you know your decompression table , do n't you ?	232.3764572939392
 You know I know it , Robinson answered warily .	315.7513408563459
 You came straight up from 275 without a stop , Artie said .	185.5218796872241
 Well , I was a little bit confused .	227.4071469799588
 Anyway , I was n't down long enough to matter .	143.01999059291384
 You do n't see me stretched out on the deck , do you ?	400.7438012280418
 You know what they say about two deep dives in one day , Artie went on , still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently .	170.78579592030283
 I do n't think you should go down again .	312.4723017877414
 EARLY that day Matsuo saw a marine .	301.5112989451371
 The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery .	270.4124268414457
 As his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand .	217.3951119211003
 He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed .	371.74205060962055
 In the leafiest part of the tree , straddling a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow .	70.44679073585617
 For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .	423.5204957425868
 He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably bred indecision , they would soon come hunting .	276.6775531296913
 His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure .	449.0701114138422
 Yesterday ; today ; tomorrow no surrender .	649.9302812468492
 His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace- only a faint chill of doubt .	598.2675003819423
 He murmured to himself , with firmness No surrender .	312.4291585084648
 It was best to die fighting the marines .	166.29292274736983
 His superiors had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor .	345.0853309883652
 What if the marines never came ?	145.6760434977126
 His comrades were all dead .	507.94291406512514
 He had no rice .	81.6484103925272
 Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .	319.1829653408853
 Whichever the way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes .	180.39985568240806
 He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk .	159.96577638154082
 His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .	686.8049378082006
 The knife , an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt .	259.04161902305367
 Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth .	342.9024055006562
 As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing .	172.4569050489903
 Gloom receded .	14.832135336663535
 The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though debating whether to brave the sunlight .	302.17717064222705
 His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist .	222.29524888565433
 Come out , come out in the meadow , Matsuo said under his breath .	126.58177551331951
 The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face .	267.15983539927953
 A signal ?	627.5177010071588
 Matsuo lifted his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness .	237.0136531011899
 Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills .	332.1427129892201
 They had fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out .	127.00736435668435
 Even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows .	136.74440682011945
 A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing .	163.59966005679212
 The marines let him advance .	231.1782718960546
 When he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy .	195.42661398431278
 Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses , both the burned and the unburned , the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun .	115.31312216929783
 The callous marines had laughed at each other 's retching , while stacking bodies .	188.44935792758253
 Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea .	78.83682133410984
 At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle , reeking of death .	86.3087395183589
 Apprehensively he peered to the left , to the right into the leafy , vine-crisscrossed maze .	55.35289416544205
 He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow , with the one left to distract him .	51.36618850961014
 He strained his hearing .	525.0346809359722
 Cautious feet stepping on leafmold ; faint creaking of belts and slings ; whispers he heard none of these .	313.12881770892517
 Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird .	168.35499192418555
 Because he could n't hear them , he was more convinced they were there .	208.98343722242834
 A spectacle occurred across the meadow the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it .	146.3566916530276
 Humiliation made Matsuo tremble .	203.6160987403752
 While his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver .	242.55166395286884
 Taking aim at the man 's face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind .	231.8095846590442
 He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .	238.5304143026904
 The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound .	217.41503732779077
 Hush followed .	98.3108230133317
 Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment , Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle .	298.11813585171797
 How stupid to give his position away .	352.44239365339604
 The jungle did not retort .	26.98032095157302
 The sitter remained seated hugging the tree .	632.2521773089704
 Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy , and insects hummed and birds occasionally called .	259.8813553486673
 Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke .	224.36991826424048
 Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes .	1345.7591306694055
 He went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind chasing of the tail .	181.3179364646456
 It ended when he tumbled ; but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction .	295.0201960855207
 He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon .	405.94694289871245
 With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo 's direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop .	61.212313328257075
 When he got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face .	240.34204744738963
 The pockets of his jacket bulged .	122.95626482610503
 Hand grenades .	5232.4641494623165
 the bobbing head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk .	134.40778997082225
 The marine spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward .	204.4460506781269
 In the hush that followed the echoes , Matsuo was tense .	118.34745843644538
 They could come on him now without difficulty .	238.07079426941155
 Gradually he reached a conclusion .	130.17963545328251
 The marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree .	280.22525739445587
 Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage .	413.23398745099246
 The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended .	1339.2389735402544
 Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out .	261.38038545956914
 Reflex ?	63.05174629432322
 Rifle leveled on the man , he made a rush .	118.5668682450808
 Heat , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd .	329.9228646782653
 He squatted by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground .	163.7857807902596
 With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back .	396.3842221352531
 He was bearded .	119.84421784442941
 The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone ; around the hole , blood glistened in a little patch .	179.19926791649524
 Maintaining his clutch on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets .	200.38464135524964
 In one a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man 's bleeding .	175.12571209011233
 In the other a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief .	278.74093595970277
 One by one he tossed the objects aside .	716.6197437575292
 He did n't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter ; he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running .	408.507991459015
 Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .	367.1762806854481
 Too bad the marine had no water .	744.4439719808947
 From its holder he took his own canteen .	226.04534593576986
 The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure .	250.54489385557693
 The marine 's eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened squinted in the glare .	258.32548174992377
 So , alive .	328.21243743767405
 Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .	216.48628367694153
 The marine reached up a hand .	351.3947856051422
 Matsuo shook his head .	198.84111158966508
 None for you .	576.473129012664
 The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand .	294.93470886166875
 Not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on .	245.97212723389472
 You came well equipped to die .	604.0594422428154
 Some odor made him lean over the man .	609.0425461696419
 He sniffed and recognized it .	66.19378789068071
 Sake .	28.833267318421218
 So that had been his difficulty .	133.45680763221986
 Drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac .	82.82853510366898
 The marine tried to roll on his right side , and moaned .	188.30929112705812
 When he rolled on the left side , propping on his left elbow , Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over .	241.1424949910594
 Be a good turtle .	1088.1105911172633
 Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle .	296.3632306708261
 The smell of sake had freshened yesterday 's events in his thoughts .	363.31764463441027
 In the caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake .	154.28694823004852
 The marine shut his eyes .	661.8613955122873
 Are you a thrower of flame , marine ?	476.85884886939033
 Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine 's reach and away from their shadows .	205.9259472058754
 He waited in his squat , gripping the hair .	68.36150593685466
 Every so often he turned the knife .	391.67957792333823
 Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .	981.7526915969105
 The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping .	132.3669185757949
 Wet also were the marine 's fatigues and the face had an oily film .	195.03895802124148
 The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes .	232.57124773754947
 Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle .	267.29290610289274
 He must have saturated himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze .	159.14004084570735
 Matsuo shook his head .	199.635549003198
 Strange .	28.982303319421813
 At last he reached for the knife .	235.267503217796
 Even the bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine 's handkerchief to wrap it .	188.11409659305548
 First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes .	312.86763515461683
 The marine yelled and flung the hand away .	91.70535187945433
 With a firm grip on the man 's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek .	451.3681250705787
 A shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo 's wrist .	74.33198334369152
 Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat ; burned the other cheek ; burned each hand when they came groping again .	580.1107852518994
 The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment .	384.00335254050543
 Matsuo stood up .	73.94127201166293
 A small measure of payment , marine .	676.1770202361071
 He dropped the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder .	251.4598815651401
 The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach .	265.23409854127243
 He ceased weeping .	1096.5605802306698
 Matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back .	191.9316480523148
 The marine was still .	248.03651205440897
 He would soon die .	213.65493522788748
 As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow .	186.07528583464597
 What now ?	265.48185524823583
 In the jungle , birds were mute , while insects preserved only the monotony of living .	196.85798315646085
 Someone called .	1955.398238499447
 It was the marine head lifted , he strained and called .	402.0798954639063
 Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat .	331.3661809977269
 He cupped his mouth and yelled .	41.647633430601644
 Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder .	210.0909539023854
 Once and for all he 'd finish this marine who would not die .	780.0507488336798
 He aimed , but listened .	235.64616872003282
 It sounded as if the man were calling him Hey , Japanese h hey there , Japanese .	262.3438159493232
 The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container .	276.60919817108277
 He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .	525.9348980407997
 Sake ?	63.11071561517432
 Matsuo called .	143.4987869572206
 The marine nodded vigorously .	2568.3389055673533
 Matsuo laughed , slung the rifle .	99.19716878247691
 The marine was a winehead .	68.62550080933268
 His superiors had said that all marines were depraved .	52.86587518045088
 The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol .	564.7204401519662
 Remembering his own thirst , Matsuo took out his water bottle .	161.73129441809
 One swallow was all he would have ; he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline .	289.6849393487326
 His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline .	214.81063064996482
 He began to uncap the bottle , the rusty cap squealing on its threads .	129.71284874128781
 Popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted .	346.61398631752013
 Of course it was water he really craved ; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out .	183.95105694882994
 The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack .	450.4952536147245
 Matsuo shook his head .	197.92167917938508
 He had no water for an enemy .	102.13772174051363
 And when this was gone , he had n't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool .	175.8811745390877
 He capped the bottle and replaced it .	119.56227590922174
 After all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine .	242.86460785957786
 Before much longer the marine quieted down .	316.5143922279662
 His head slumped .	85.97078087706996
 The upper part of his packet had stained dark .	146.14203168115773
 Marine .	3340.468382744548
 There is nothing for you , Matsuo said .	86.72857216330326
 Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion , besides the dishonor of it .	204.60225859195128
 I 've nothing for you .	303.5195542305709
 From the convulsive quivers of the man 's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping .	169.47611804526375
 He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China .	326.4705532069557
 In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , smudged , blood-specked , with the village burning about him and shells exploding .	337.5660258724452
 CHAIRS SCRAPED BACK and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar .	1124.6255163877008
 Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were .	569.0660032451725
 Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame .	251.15413852405612
 He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed .	152.65418853397622
 Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys ?	348.2118264072875
 he asked .	307.672799512477
 Seems to me I do n't remember altering any law about that .	355.1131320203546
 He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer .	426.0279059066381
 Stay right here where you are , kid , he called .	266.31509327965574
 I do n't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I 'm a-drinking The stranger ignored him .	643.1829386029681
 He did n't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader 's right hand was on the butt of his revolver .	465.39484838740924
 I 'm Billy Tilghman , said the stranger , and I 've come for Pat Conyers ' body .	434.70733130795423
 And what makes you think you 're going to get it , pretty boy ?	589.9776611284454
 Because I 'm asking .	679.5311129824116
 Most of the time I get what I ask for .	292.55200420463774
 Blue Throat winked at his six cronies .	121.10119269257248
 The kid has no manners , boys .	582.4014965621874
 Shall we teach him some ?	2106.864902066275
 His gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster .	271.3455057626252
 Tilghman 's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin .	236.1610404874024
 His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling .	224.68626527267057
 Tilghman leapt on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him careening against the bar .	130.49112212418325
 A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman 's stomach as Blue Throat 's henchmen started shooting .	621.6283365611974
 Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun .	426.3595809281277
 The Colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing .	241.85386121553336
 A third shot doused the light .	191.9786100830869
 Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , You all right , Billy ?	384.14331002274236
 Yes , George , but I ai n't got poor old Pat 's body yet .	1193.8446333085444
 And I aim to have it .	132.04202148865082
 He fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed .	346.96529647759075
 Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor .	394.057964794658
 OK , Tilghman , I 'm quitting .	30.85771112133431
 And me , said another Blue Throat henchman .	168.012982106468
 Somebody brought a light .	1092.1814784681171
 Tilghman and his partner , George Rust , herded the men into a corner .	102.22820199529247
 And now , said Tilghman with deadly calm , I 'll repeat what I said .	296.67783558408144
 I 've come for Pat Conyers ' body .	778.8435170490166
 In two minutes the body of Tilghman 's former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town 's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial .	323.8225367297015
 Blue Throat , nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight .	335.63293166541183
 That critter will be back tomorrow , predicted George Rust , and he 'll bring fifty of his kind back with him .	256.46398362910526
 Blue Throat wo n't stand for this .	877.690473224892
 He 'll shoot up the town .	222.00721756735177
 The prediction was correct .	226.05124609584348
 The Reverend James Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers ' last rites on Boot Hill in the township of Petrie , when shots were heard in the distance .	242.1572627704114
 Amen , said the Reverend Doran , grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone , and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere .	208.50303453033902
 Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle .	364.697497252124
 Blue Throat , who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months , certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship .	292.47768267173893
 It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring , ruthless gun-slinger , and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it .	221.98761909672285
 He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street .	199.42356469663972
 The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn .	269.5853038375174
 Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat 's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire .	1193.0941145416239
 The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster 's Store , halfway down the street .	168.28750300855071
 Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived .	985.9883238769364
 He sized up the situation and shook his head .	130.79349718443942
 If Blue Throat has his way he 'll keep us all cooped up in here for days , he said .	262.5638165389912
 There 's only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store .	248.51361242564545
 He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom .	205.1574864102979
 Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite .	717.8063820212024
 I 'm gon na drop these into Blue Throat 's lap , he announced , and I 'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window .	630.2885296024035
 He slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways .	123.12934562580183
 Blue Throat 's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed .	464.82644288896535
 Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber 's shop and came out at the back .	212.95187265925347
 Here he could n't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang .	258.4559195785688
 All he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through .	251.9834064884857
 Billy Tilghman did just that .	375.357174167236
 Within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters , with every outlaw either dead or injured inside .	414.9397832679407
 It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat 's dictatorship in Petrie .	156.39620769920472
 Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts .	731.698215069438
 To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising , smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet .	313.273150145004
 Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West , Uncle Billy Tilghman stands out head and shoulders .	595.4196933663384
 He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book .	139.9712870336448
 He saw the most action , beat up more badmen with his bare fists , broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other US marshal who lived before or after him .	378.93212330570674
 For fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West .	392.74944271446606
 The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career , his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung .	227.1455072206372
 Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century .	381.7432478683809
 He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890 's .	335.70446889974164
 Led by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns .	385.8190171910565
 Bill Doolin 's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him .	240.390728338817
 Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .	61.69146918606452
 They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses .	273.960617393655
 Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort .	1211.8753974670633
 On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn 's ranch .	473.6065442891722
 It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .	308.02355757731505
 The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was belching out thick smoke .	318.1261268280717
 The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .	501.92760949767495
 Wait here , Neal , said Tilghman .	105.975627078614
 If I do n't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse .	628.1685379320398
 Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it .	96.99304768238117
 There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside .	324.0683096618711
 Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day .	941.0918512164207
 Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed Dunn .	276.16554210906514
 Hello , Ed , said Tilghman .	103.56003851285797
 The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but did n't move .	231.60217156420583
 Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire .	335.97177128477887
 Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck .	249.0858607130228
 Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain .	364.5245825200851
 And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman .	223.2480529743452
 The fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide .	378.0518523292494
 Thinking fast , Tilghman never hesitated for one instant .	412.78342691833285
 He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him .	293.08845625468774
 The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang- every man a killer .	329.63919363694515
 Cold day , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire .	327.14235559547143
 Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives .	500.2370268799189
 Ca n't seem to locate landmarks in this snow .	454.1443890590288
 The rancher was trembling .	330.29954184826596
 He would n't look Tilghman in the face .	66.39581280751888
 Follow the river for five miles , he said hoarsely .	228.56482761472586
 Jed 's homestead is on the south bank .	107.34035535351468
 Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes .	520.2183287974013
 All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body .	615.0622435347398
 One false move on his part and he would be a dead man .	276.7386257915446
 Well , he announced , Guess I 'll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the warmup .	148.4611937968913
 He strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him .	97.65784859131135
 He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive .	631.9939639140086
 But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon .	483.57792755636063
 If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .	568.5568523800856
 Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown .	243.82805028938787
 Do n't say or do anything , he said softly .	295.5453221306102
 Just get out of here without it looking as though we 're in a hurry .	623.9726900971987
 That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang .	193.47997767026905
 Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman 's life hung on a thread .	778.9262175359811
 Back in the house a hoodlum named Red Buck , sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then .	677.8960252546002
 You 'll stay right here , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle .	871.8030180384953
 Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back .	275.3380571378048
 We 'll let him go .	376.6623274456108
 But the fighting marshal 's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , Oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets .	426.62093378209346
 Wiley Lynn , a self-styled prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since .	1000.7988877872419
 That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy 's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver .	646.4993166348453
 FOR SEVERAL MONTHS now , Jack Carter , a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy , pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a Woman .	121.23509022209942
 This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth ; she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately .	295.617566011766
 When she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach .	386.140028692644
 Then he would run to the toilet behind the house .	154.69241730784825
 Sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this Woman was almost always with him .	205.57329843245066
 He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him .	337.87292275315326
 But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right .	287.3794070288881
 And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the Woman of Jack 's mind assumed the teacher 's face and figure .	214.92261079453039
 He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do .	226.18446845880027
 When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh .	149.2020846169909
 Miss Langford her first name was Evelyn was an attractive girl .	384.18276671884854
 Tall , blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress .	256.94188457319603
 Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack .	280.8189807758992
 She would look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick .	207.1216515532196
 School began in August , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another .	223.0754731790048
 The first two or three days they went home early .	625.0212524168592
 All , that is , except Jack .	240.12418626232065
 He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order .	209.05055855814535
 Once this was on the third day of school she kneeled down to pick up some books where they 'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg .	400.9346809820145
 He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating .	387.8379351204194
 About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she did n't even see him .	251.349252898501
 He jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school .	116.19547322324243
 He did n't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; then he slowed to a walk .	196.09306748491872
 The vision became even stronger now .	549.7257859938863
 I 'll get her yet , he muttered to himself .	305.6186814861915
 I 've got to get her .	303.42620646828163
 That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire .	245.71959032114137
 He ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily .	357.8545109339347
 What 's the matter , honey ?	255.19323006947656
 she said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child .	90.3884363977942
 Are n't you hungry ?	1917.153553956843
 No , I 'm not hungry , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs .	203.51314502794756
 Outside it was already hot at 730 AM , and it was getting hot in the kitchen .	594.7706706294099
 He felt a little sick at his stomach .	213.17211588612375
 Are you sick ?	2512.945978736188
 No , he said .	47.93791034632062
 I 'll be all right .	181.4717452932013
 I guess it 's this hot weather .	609.1698995354509
 Do n't you play hard today then .	1124.553994331962
 And if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early .	784.8691305721376
 Daddy left the car for me , and I 'm going to town this afternoon .	257.54755899427937
 O K , I wo n't play hard , he promised .	855.1275876729361
 Just then Charles Lever yelled , Hey , Jack , from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling Good-bye , Mom over his shoulder .	188.61871435583083
 Whaddya say , boy ?	263.9199696798857
 Charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth .	467.11426451292726
 Charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , scraggly , with straight black hair like an Indian 's and sharp brown eyes .	535.0142953559109
 He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .	361.02284279754724
 You know what I done last night ?	987.2868524310447
 Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .	337.4924935365185
 Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were Charles ' only apparent interest .	534.6513598610281
 But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles ' revelations even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention , so he usually invited them , as he did now .	365.58421853278026
 No .	248.71429174086288
 What ?	249.65037235078424
 I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry .	296.0305546299063
 A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack 's mind .	776.1954973233239
 His heart beat faster .	2124.0845696712113
 Hell you say ?	212.29607228042494
 he said , lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles .	190.43315769864114
 How 'd you do it ?	393.1359103504892
 Hell , I jist got on top of- No , I mean how 'd you get her to do it ?	286.6939633496735
 Hell , I jist ask her .	97.73496029819874
 Jist like that ?	148.6087881295882
 Hell , yes .	66.84434993293301
 She 's been hangin ' around me a lot here lately , and I figgered I might as well 's try it .	327.56868376094394
 Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin ' it .	347.44334481475113
 I never heard that .	219.46594453519768
 It 's all over Branchville .	89.22832753437969
 If you 'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself .	597.810626970434
 I might try it one of these days , Jack said wonderingly , thinking of Miss Langford .	269.62851629776054
 WHEN THEY reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse .	474.90294634211216
 Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .	170.6031478611662
 Time for books , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand .	325.8524357588012
 Let 's go inside .	504.26353738353464
 Oh , come on Miss Langford , play with us just onct , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully .	167.23162187231162
 No , not now , said the teacher .	110.02055783653859
 Maybe at dinner time .	960.9488838723713
 Come inside now .	1387.8276392031569
 The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse .	112.35994174269912
 Jack watched Miss Langford all morning .	1358.5746229261863
 He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider .	666.2220101152935
 Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he coud hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did .	392.2270358450145
 At noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball .	425.63004107188067
 Why ai n't you playin ' ball ?	920.413390591695
 he asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse .	175.68279091178914
 Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised , several of the little girls called .	358.0166704949301
 I 'd druther stay here and watch the girls , Charles grinned .	640.3406317285851
 Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we 'll see up their dress .	863.8511078667104
 Maybe , Jack said idly , watching for Miss Langford .	304.3710640000273
 Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .	142.71918102700303
 When she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , Goody , goody .	132.5754818519526
 Let 's play with 'em , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants .	337.3425165167261
 OK Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls .	244.78532524027057
 They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap .	697.373152342238
 Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head .	293.3209971180803
 While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , Gosh , I 'm sorry , Miss Langford .	367.17121964237685
 I did n't mean to pull so hard .	332.59908411382025
 That 's all right , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes .	186.26199185783946
 It was my fault .	158.3490187786864
 With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack 's extended hand with the other .	799.2235605012976
 When her hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet .	575.6608437848996
 He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .	323.514884062859
 Thank you , she said , dusting herself off .	99.0941963073922
 Will you play with us again , Miss Langford ?	490.6225935383791
 one of the little girls said .	205.07423664630699
 No more today .	273.19723576291887
 Maybe some other day .	528.4775562316815
 Oh , shucks , the girl said .	75.55084828866333
 I do n't believe I 'll play any more neither .	647.7884690867405
 Me neither , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone .	446.6764377185933
 Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun , past Robert Allen 's three-room , tarpapered house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes .	358.967102799281
 When he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up .	63.268735753694116
 He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class .	256.98041015856273
 That should do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work .	235.5709310781475
 He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he could n't take a chance on either of these possibilities the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school .	322.0511313157058
 The only drawback now to the plan he 'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack .	397.99975563853025
 But I 've got to take a chance on it , he told himself desperately .	281.5746764578434
 To his surprise his plan worked perfectly .	1146.5028319647902
 All right , if you ca n't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school it out , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling .	485.9258539861292
 You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems .	1412.327554770048
 And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home .	322.84594752069637
 He scarcely saw them .	247.80115087629068
 His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , How will I do it ?	375.40486006966535
 On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise .	222.50571098944275
 She munched little ginger cakes called mulatto 's belly and kept her green , somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck .	519.1704880403314
 The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman .	342.8074092282019
 Lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family .	188.82612525405474
 The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured Look at your watch , Col Garvier .	491.5060660890358
 It is almost time for and calinda to begin .	128.8605034497966
 Col Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans ' most important and enlightened slave owners .	2037.349632813798
 He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start .	158.6088906762627
 The slaves ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name .	425.23416129352745
 Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum .	743.5409749608345
 He showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently , his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy .	96.0995487114307
 The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds .	230.845270542297
 The dance was of Haitian origin .	152.23168145847893
 The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows .	245.49950434290977
 He was possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners .	156.97386406664089
 He proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the South 's oldest and most cherished names .	294.4012175244801
 Delphine was a pace-setter in high society .	48.89244511984907
 She was a top horsewoman and one of the city 's most gracious hostesses .	101.87062027193197
 Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil .	215.51450719422604
 Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders .	491.50349775293813
 The slender , handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves .	264.64826209897444
 He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race .	444.78199881312287
 But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his master 's plantation in Bayou St John .	285.9099833560936
 Shy , actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls ' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses .	238.23324229897023
 This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near .	592.4337465380898
 The woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection .	342.15256430358215
 What is your name , boy ?	325.929080013893
 Come a bit closer .	2033.5273379577118
 I wo n't bite , you know .	501.97848342157215
 He gaped at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her .	231.92421389963803
 Then he smiled shyly .	135.69177002501854
 My name is Dandy Brandon , missy .	71.37975307574044
 I belong to Master Alexander Prieur .	597.9085515294294
 She said with intense feeling Come near , let me feel your arms .	1562.393733001977
 You look quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy .	318.1494909532496
 Mrs Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage .	561.9020048020931
 Lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm .	206.1681818928141
 The woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor .	111.7943866205797
 Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees .	254.04897457902808
 Satisfied at last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver .	219.10704775354452
 This was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows .	34.941489121928534
 Aristide !	67.0344343286347
 I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy 's purchase .	328.25518898364675
 There 's $ 600 in gold in this chamois sack .	114.57212305291822
 If the old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer .	613.234558570321
 Prieur has gout and depends on Louis ' pills and bleedings .	99.3631679149227
 Besides , he owns 300 slaves .	1489.4229759547252
 One less should n't matter to him .	258.16208934519415
 Aristide Devol , the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native Sierra Leone , smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat .	145.19755466526436
 His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .	337.11353948023253
 Another youth , Madame ?	1361.299520479292
 the coachman said softly .	313.9600481948997
 This one is a tender chicken , oui ?	313.492571820177
 Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh .	1690.0546327853765
 It will rip and shred easily for Madame .	177.8734217749911
 Be quiet , Devol !	415.70507382472664
 You are forgetting your place .	180.90851328809515
 The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur .	247.6404513988987
 Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon- cowering in the back seat of the carriage- to her mansion at 677 Perdido Street .	74.33360829112566
 Dr Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion .	157.05842405770656
 Dandy , curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle .	194.1691577813902
 He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head .	155.7428139835647
 Dr Lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket , and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses .	183.2625470825619
 He was about 50 years old .	282.8371520770806
 Another young man , my dear ?	585.7476426036653
 Really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself , he said , frowning with displeasure .	83.20385712982481
 Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster .	88.13448511795134
 Dandy is to be our house guest , Louis .	221.82851981772055
 I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways .	361.2905668343173
 He deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation .	229.5980570755174
 Quite so , my dear .	624.7592452250026
 His room will be ready shortly .	561.6777811690336
 The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave .	249.4345461044211
 Had Dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries ' tender care if he valued his life .	352.7732499207573
 But he liked the smell of Delphine 's perfume .	211.88432326237668
 Besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth .	221.5011730749609
 Also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony .	296.85151450135976
 So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home .	140.94743404785996
 Airless and dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St John .	293.8342456336783
 He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie- after closing the door- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber .	327.7120748165866
 It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell .	185.83146797903152
 When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street , he was carried out in a coroner 's basket .	127.44619884687292
 JUST six weeks after Dandy Brandon 's arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New Orleans ' oldest and wealthiest families were invited .	342.7882459069422
 A stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms , and Delphine circulated graciously among her guests , chatting airily of the forthcoming races , the latest fashions from Paris , and Louisiana politics .	218.63405049337155
 Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase .	98.27678311513132
 It was Dandy Brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him .	67.34282255656306
 The lad 's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts .	406.25353331268235
 His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .	153.6567501600365
 Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted Evil woman !	579.34712100262
 You did this h you like to hurt h to beat people h I want h to go home .	541.5436034581498
 These were the last words he ever uttered .	421.05792335851214
 Convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore .	118.0456077754379
 Dr Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead .	362.88380526342434
 The ball broke up in confusion .	508.0258728794842
 Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures .	551.5323895119467
 Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse .	246.49062397286858
 But at the coroner 's inquest Delphine told a forthright story .	57.846617898639586
 I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him .	442.32172792717984
 It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest .	321.9359797598479
 After I paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night .	271.65513389442
 How he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , I can not say .	132.89482151487516
 Dr Lalaurie and I did n't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs .	205.84359266203126
 She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion That poor boy !	550.0593460647116
 He must have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced .	345.7690718158464
 Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die .	434.04610280899686
 Such a pitiful end !	185.72270715792823
 Though the slave 's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner 's panel , Dandy 's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded .	157.86229233761307
 The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury did n't feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady .	156.15110503431146
 Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans ' dives .	1175.8259148660325
 So the verict was death at the hands of a person or persons unknown , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine 's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold .	152.35592619980127
 Once again life went its serene way- soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners .	1173.3917418091798
 The excitement over Brandon 's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie 's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital .	343.71118799324694
 Then , on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip .	265.40908776336096
 Mrs Victor Dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight .	386.25402044784437
 The manservant Devol and his mistress , Delphine Lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion .	52.00888688581433
 The girl was not more than 16 .	171.9908364045218
 She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back .	439.14636631882945
 The bleeding girl was tiring fast ; the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street .	301.95441055992
 The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice Help me , somebody !	179.741297415511
 They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw !	522.0681248928818
 Bastards , he would say , all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me !	152.90685747597863
 Since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent- and even indecent- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero , he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper .	199.63383326128073
 There ai n't nothin ' faster , or lonelier , or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wan na go someplace , Feathertop would say .	170.98434101209298
 The accommodations may not be the poshest , but man !	125.85613098595125
 there ai n't nobody askin ' for your ticket stub , neither .	819.6897201852873
 He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now .	70.81495273106533
 Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child .	69.17005460484648
 Ever since all that .	542.8101911041012
 It had been a very long time that had no form and no end .	112.38437524877082
 He was- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own- riding the dark train out .	156.7579160713856
 Out and out and never to return again .	357.592540265309
 Till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped .	180.01950793964426
 That was the day it ended .	165.0445040873462
 THE FREIGHT CAR WAS COLD , early in the morning .	141.01380265517707
 He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .	127.08730635884217
 He held his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly .	131.53886410746546
 The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn- then with a clash into its slot .	288.6236366905608
 The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .	149.28686291469748
 She pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and Feathertop 's music pffft-ed away .	436.01448440775874
 Now that is a very nice , a very nice , he murmured to himself , back in his corner .	251.62698297091544
 A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted .	247.59096053338632
 Hot , that was the word , hot !	250.10447190811647
 Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow 's wings , with the sun shining down over them .	143.65349349719432
 A poet , yet !	243.36081037770973
 His thoughts for the swanlike neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however .	216.93968533020234
 Zingggg-O !	67.14097002816108
 Then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting .	416.16677695299904
 He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .	147.6115004901781
 Curly hair , high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer 's blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes- but then I 'm finished .	214.02154992592196
 We made it , Cappy , the chick said .	35.25856956413248
 Yeah , seems so , do n't it , the boy laughed , hugging her close .	135.3367682559514
 Ah-ah !	67.10726327528627
 Feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants .	46.51908219892737
 None of that .	445.96225536645665
 We run a respectable house here .	533.3172626922384
 They whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall .	260.18220234880255
 He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes .	115.50343656137528
 He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .	440.56031197431963
 Come sit , said Feathertop , motioning them toward him .	184.013454253837
 That crap is softer over here .	74.32334552426528
 The girl smiled , and started forward .	340.79183929440734
 The boy yanked her back hard , tugging her off her feet , and gathered her into the crook of his arm .	170.15366565013298
 Now stay with me , Kitty , he snapped irritably .	144.72798112040584
 I vowed to take care of you- and that 's what I 'm gon na do .	154.31060061879643
 We do n't know this guy .	385.0225875313865
 Oooo , square bit , Feathertop screwed his face up .	328.7045740070918
 This guy was strictly from Outsville .	254.44313665956963
 But nowhere !	766.2191763826145
 What is with this vow jazz ?	186.8514977600516
 Feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight 's vibrating wall .	138.36214663224976
 We- we eloped , Cappy said .	29.935161582053688
 His head came up and he said it defiantly .	128.49374130351757
 Well , congratulations .	44.59289749797379
 Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .	305.09222348296066
 These two were going to be easy pickins .	162.02196478089016
 They could n't have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much .	172.3663848936497
 And besides , the chick had a little something the others did n't have .	218.6093275583778
 That was gon na be fun collecting !	465.4710150558489
 But not just yet .	224.1370768843321
 Feathertop was a connoisseur .	10.736955612514368
 He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it .	116.55973012644033
 Come sit , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings .	240.98011879502695
 I 'm just a poor ex-jazz man , name of- uh- Boyd Smith .	191.08525211615589
 He grinned at them wolfishly .	142.97630301394338
 That ai n't your name , Mister , the boy accused .	230.82543334489415
 And you know- you 're right !	412.3765369482546
 Feathertop aimed a finger at him .	250.76788063006006
 Oh , come on , Cappy , the girl chided .	83.67727615912597
 He 's okay .	17.494887420965828
 He 's a nice guy .	369.782578180996
 She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her .	768.903216034211
 Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle .	345.12482468506187
 He cleared his throat ; it had been a long , hot while since he 'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin ' distance .	531.7064970947068
 He had it all doped , of course .	50.46147513196016
 Slug the kid , grab his dough- at least enough to get to Philadelphia- and then have a rockin ' ball with the doll .	168.33583085391146
 Hmm- diddle !	36.16431502531517
 Where 'd you come from , Mr- uh- Mr Smith ?	556.710415065011
 Kitty inquired politely .	111.69782848763691
 Where from ?	1319.078283434496
 he mused .	73.10775590523517
 Out .	496.74230218002214
 I been riding train for a ways now .	561.0538102208585
 They lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself .	132.0780927976181
 After a while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , We 'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly , honey .	378.092985214057
 What 's the matter , she wan na go the bathroom ?	207.6349888314115
 Ernie found it immensely funny .	1019.6715377759448
 The boy scowled at him , and the girl looked shocked .	140.07492360450996
 No !	434.35661270278786
 Certainly not , I mean , no that is n't what I said !	301.6499965788767
 she snapped at him .	580.7545900060779
 I only said I was hungry .	358.69183558409975
 We have n't had anything to eat all day .	352.66166050891076
 Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill 's voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .	490.3693659386443
 Why n't ya say so , fellow travelers !	1038.8979527644651
 Why , we got dinner right here .	550.3877321581446
 C'mon , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we 'll have food in a minute or two .	378.1904243111118
 Cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .	53.929473207323475
 Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .	919.0697001734411
 He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it .	519.0564070380841
 He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .	336.63102746218806
 A charcoal pit , man , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier .	130.21177397514347
 Fan it , he told Cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper .	89.27936629231117
 Yeah , but what 're we gon na eat ?	171.89070739395808
 Charcoal ?	60.67028790054813
 Fella , Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man , you try my ever-lovin ' patience .	248.39282272714007
 He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners .	341.50631552119586
 Hot dogs , man .	1071.6405360406018
 Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides .	222.92145746400837
 He ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil .	225.21568186229425
 Almost immediately they began to sizzle .	197.53081353764784
 He looked up and grinned .	155.06631461852146
 A Kroger 's self-serve , he explained .	43.06961515689376
 I self served .	704.3502303249454
 WHEN THEY HAD LICKED the last of the wieners ' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette .	159.01334718439279
 Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad .	175.8862877418014
 How come you 're riding the rods , kids like you ?	501.85925309711763
 Ernie asked .	71.7553236451469
 Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply .	147.18440808453448
 But surprisingly , Kitty 's face came up and she said , My father .	263.694523054402
 He did n't want us to get married .	254.01352791835714
 So we ran away .	277.98747455979515
 Why did n't he want you to get hitched ?	221.15778772975645
 This time even she did not answer .	297.81359796527397
 She looked down at her hands , too .	203.23759443462328
 After a few seconds , she said , Dad did n't like Cappy .	117.41843361972431
 It was my fault .	158.41950987221693
 Cappy 's head came around sharply .	293.3336986333763
 Your fault , hell !	2480.16340670484
 It was all my fault .	200.06849022375965
 If I 'd been careful it never woulda- he stopped abruptly .	742.9294808806947
 Ernie 's eyebrows went up .	63.12090844637672
 What 's the matter ?	193.08568925174703
 The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , I 'm pregnant .	516.6849034912141
 Cappy raged at himself .	52.463066681055
 Oh he was stupid , her old man !	514.1691282713444
 You never heard nothin ' like it Kitty 's gon na go have an abortion , and Kitty 's gon na go away to a convent , and Kitty 's this and Kitty 's that h like he was nuts or somethin ' , y'know ?	124.17267096199868
 Ernie nodded .	268.6306705762938
 This was a slightly different matter .	193.8505320812599
 He remembered Midge , and the child .	52.96791080069084
 But that had been a time before all this , a time he did n't think about .	174.52733050484613
 A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out .	191.72580018730977
 But these kids were n't like him .	236.80327350921684
 Oh crap !	281.3736014132992
 he thought , Pull out of it , old son .	161.49553826957214
 These are just another couple of characters to roll .	600.6364897376266
 What they got , you get .	256.18721591159147
 Now forget all this other .	665.1949994153374
 Wan na drink ?	246.44687858069153
 Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket .	208.79221894302597
 Yeah .	28.705444887763647
 Now that you offer .	358.0923902305281
 The answer came from the open door of the boxcar .	67.24345802734824
 From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade .	299.8629860768264
 Ernie stared at the man .	71.66029959695008
 He was big .	76.18591076262808
 Real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly .	272.60178037096864
 Road gang , Ernie thought .	672.2160985410293
 You gon na give me a drink , fella ?	181.53598398003385
 the big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar .	201.3068532279412
 Ernie hesitated a moment .	269.8214148074938
 This character could break him in half .	367.26326743717027
 Sure , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips .	117.8701114898197
 He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder .	47.36372122534422
 The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring .	361.6482320261135
 He took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .	196.74557111939748
 He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously .	111.27279137128116
 He belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .	210.88708975490073
 Well , now , he said , and reached into his pocket .	107.37728443965466
 I did n't know I was gon na have company in this car .	181.03774114877123
 We 're going to Philadelphia , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more .	566.4343761219012
 No , I do n't think so , said the big man , and it was the final clincher for Ernie .	89.3440116256228
 He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it .	199.94770659970342
 Maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ai n't goin ' nowhere .	343.9861788460705
 He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car .	276.4235260623827
 Ernie was screaming inside himself No , damn you , you ai n't gon na take my meal ticket away from me !	886.5523288982595
 The newcomer stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth .	122.0037420616003
 Her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard .	247.44452099138545
 The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump !	301.03805214264463
 and carried him backward in a footballer 's tackle .	305.28286738662877
 They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs .	329.8241803472646
 The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back .	189.90436860637575
 The fist went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man 's deeper voice go , Aaawww !	369.06890174821007
 Then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade .	159.47743772828366
 He held the knife aloft an instant- an instant enough to press the stud .	408.7194237306558
 The blade came out with a snick !	130.5817347703461
 He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid 's throat .	120.7896992688656
 Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .	218.8329469020855
 She grabbed at Feathertop 's sleeve and shrieked , Help him !	79.07292713638361
 Help him !	98.59381496951956
 Do something !	1040.3320572929542
 They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man .	1891.5810746225488
 To them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after Mass , and at noon , and at six each evening- its tone , repetitive , monotonous , never breaking the boredom of the streets .	294.3205246633174
 The Old Man was unimportant .	559.6032575851366
 Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June ; or the smell of thick tomato paste- the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour- rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth .	340.84990815763956
 Or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights .	263.81175766527446
 Or the bay of female dogs in heat .	885.460450315114
 They never called him by name , although he had one .	160.65727162900487
 Filippo Rossi , that 's what he was called in the old country ; but here he was just Signore or the Old Man .	136.66970361440968
 But this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders .	389.25542817730866
 Youth obeyed when commanded .	1009.1974057197882
 It went to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession .	582.1199004961328
 But youth asked nothing of its parents- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing .	198.6644095738386
 The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened .	590.2144910193736
 But the past was dead here as the present was dead .	160.30597272887974
 Once the Old Man had had a wife .	320.09401989585314
 And once she , too , ignored him .	197.1134466886802
 With a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders , she wiggled her satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and did n't stop .	265.1412170884411
 In one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase .	337.5346918261874
 The way she strutted down the street , the Old Man would have been blind not to have noticed both .	331.27408873434604
 Without looking at him , without looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars , rode away in it , and never came back .	494.2060776666363
 But she should n't have come here in the first place , the women had said .	145.84837776698228
 No , no .	168.90415957213054
 Not that one .	153.97457757072118
 She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from Torino .	388.198044415231
 Eh , Torino !	29.08779202908463
 She gave herself fancy airs !	1733.2211199495468
 Just because she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours .	370.6715261728642
 They had slapped their thighs .	29.06520362097109
 It 's not for making pretty speeches about Dante those actresses get paid so good .	631.4464637653516
 Henh !	67.18534050894027
 Calloused fingers , caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries , had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted , never to be tweezed away .	143.588981348698
 Mauve-colored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man 's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again .	243.6553241205166
 Puttana !	67.00709340809456
 But if the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a fig .	754.2646210722752
 It was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed- watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance , as thin as the seams on her stockings , and still thinner .	119.08396857998929
 His voice had not commanded her to stop .	415.70425781227027
 It had not questioned why .	192.35789228818874
 The women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him .	510.39855428083035
 He was never without that dog .	197.4042930296854
 And his eyes- those miniature sundials of variegated yellow- had not altered their expression or direction .	280.3979482324848
 The Old Man 's very soul could have left him and flown down that street , but he would n't have had anyone know it .	255.09348820323748
 Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife .	526.6558668308604
 But when he called for his withered , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar ?	164.6691042132563
 There seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him .	361.6500035248664
 For all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in Italy , not the outskirts of Philadelphia .	160.72363219533295
 It could have been Bari or Chieti for the way it smelled .	103.93821736629315
 What did it matter to him that the park at the foot of Ash Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city 's center at half-hour intervals ?	643.498071445781
 Or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the Schuylkill ?	1062.9354905534326
 This place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness .	205.64778886337152
 To him they were one and the same .	105.24282103146888
 Sameness for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city .	362.0480083729128
 Sameness lined the streets with two-story houses the color of ash .	864.6844475724806
 It slashed the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches .	665.5627299653454
 It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors .	43.03610518892972
 Even the stable-garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it .	167.92813677780705
 And the coffee shop on Drexel Street , where the men spent their evenings and Sundays playing cards , had a rose hedge beneath its window .	880.9604116054722
 The hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it .	130.0420231742315
 Only one house on the street had no lawn before it .	290.1613917878097
 It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade .	527.3496425968103
 That was Bartoli 's shop .	66.92557082690628
 Above it , from a second-story showroom , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood .	295.67803227176614
 Did the Old Man remember them there ?	1726.798760090035
 Yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks- like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery .	169.66641759282635
 Only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences , where one man 's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy .	219.4715326490046
 Love and hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by fig trees and grape vines .	368.38452878061935
 And the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch .	1173.1462527305791
 The Old Man silently fed upon these streets .	2133.371680797036
 They kept him alive , waiting .	419.2379861698741
 Waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not .	351.663982811087
 It was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price .	117.85022755491472
 He was holding out for something .	122.83159004984553
 He was determined to hold out .	82.55098719988023
 2 The Old Man 's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich .	313.39504670598717
 At fifteen he did n't care that he had no mother , that he could n't remember her face or her touch ; neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him .	492.64693619200136
 He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have cared less about that either .	244.9526013676587
 To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .	623.7664713280068
 When he would be a man , he would be a rich man .	66.89297679816084
 He would not be like the rich Americans who lived in white-columned houses on the other side of the park .	150.28879382953912
 He would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning .	199.86238059159095
 He would not carry a brief case .	161.2122268321095
 Nor would he work at all .	221.94542919801964
 He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step .	567.9022678771634
 He would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , bowing with her running , calling out in her bowing , At your service .	326.9082326363443
 He would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff- he would not remove his gloves- and light and smoke .	328.55703847481453
 He could do that when he would be a man .	61.69816444367409
 Hey , Laura !	240.2728737492155
 he called to his sister on the porch above the steps .	400.6731933620513
 She was only ten months older than he .	488.60930662196574
 Laura , what would you say if I smoked a pipe ?	395.2181785758428
 Laura did not answer him .	343.56064877701203
 She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , gilded hair in the sun .	576.7848309250292
 One lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking , torn pales .	171.69040692452188
 Her tanned foot , whose arch swept high and white , pointed artfully toward tapering toes- toes like fingers , whose tips glowed white .	756.283063090578
 All the while she sat there , her sinewy arms swirled before her chest .	362.7678020646505
 Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii .	629.0854738139908
 It was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours .	182.9883247084303
 The eyes , blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality .	201.41294051573135
 Even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance .	167.80974961464022
 He was never sure they fully took him in .	330.19738882649307
 Pompeii called again , Laura !	376.29354813204475
 But the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it .	283.5414814061558
 She 's in a mood , he thought There 's not a month she does n't get herself in a mood .	362.6706720600635
 Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ?	493.7403641573726
 And as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him .	241.34858488315697
 Not even Laura .	906.4184969863175
 Suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat 's claret tongue , feasting against the salt taste of him .	130.82273643230454
 Above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , sallow and time-cast , encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin , stared unfalteringly at him .	263.308434238552
 Christ sake , goat , git !	190.5581979230047
 But the goat would not .	58.13276986488651
 You 're boiling milk , ai n't you ?	2136.6627419506635
 soothing it with his hand , knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch .	41.182313962900466
 Pompeii rolled over .	476.2500883995284
 His head undulated gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats .	294.62669189158686
 With his mouth opened wide , he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light , earthy taste of it .	338.67466384875274
 The boy 's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did .	295.86842929154324
 Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud .	246.85921301717718
 Its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane .	90.25644155467295
 But the boy could see only the goat 's belly .	131.05093123548656
 The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it .	527.2921005177257
 He knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he would n't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog 's back .	306.68779204905667
 There would be time enough , perhaps the Old Man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due .	286.6011519370667
 Time enough to give up his soul .	516.7885602131391
 In the meantime , six sandals , stained an ocher , the same color as Pompeii 's shaved hair , edged up close to him .	159.45847159288815
 The clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks .	125.16568864699418
 He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to Niobe , the neatest ones to Concetta , and the laced ones to Romeo , Concetta 's idiot brother .	71.69073352016541
 Pompeii expected Romeo 's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground .	334.24211352453636
 He expected Concetta 's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything .	178.97774244728197
 People came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it .	395.526315100814
 The room filled with smoke , and Maggie 's head throbbed with excitement and fatigue , but Stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that Maggie could n't bear to do anything to quench it .	319.4225053632122
 Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery .	1399.1647607305251
 In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head .	343.43018188606214
 She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her .	750.4116506192354
 She was so heavy that Maggie 's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her .	607.5987444463761
 Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .	242.7156451069697
 Worry had a great deal to do with it ; Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father 's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him .	271.2100442501266
 Mr Clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife 's people without contributing to his and his family 's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap .	566.9093580423826
 Maggie and Stuart pored over figures every night , trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more .	396.9877288021405
 In desperation Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon Do you think you could find me something I could do here at home to make some money , so I could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things ?	530.6852629871023
 It seems to me you have enough to do as it is , Eugenia said .	141.92540175317404
 She had been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again .	260.96060920800954
 I have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing something , Maggie said .	366.15472808457895
 It would make me feel a lot better , but the Woman 's Exchange is n't taking baked goods any more and I ca n't leave the baby with Grandma because she is n't strong enough and the baby 's too young to be put in a nursery .	489.8302096216598
 I should think so , Eugenia said .	117.78964203110772
 For one thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day .	740.1894136759494
 She 's so beautiful , and I do like to keep her looking nice .	414.0943974041021
 Maggie said .	35.27140031726838
 She picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck .	792.7355394184266
 She 'll be just as beautiful in something that does n't have to be ironed , Eugenia said .	160.0078542187717
 Evadna Mae Evans said she did n't put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old .	249.52328021589136
 Evadna Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from Best 's Liliputian Bazaar in New York , and I 'm sick and tired of hearing about Evadna Mae Evans .	285.9156797432555
 Well now , Maggie , you do n't have to snap at me , Eugenia said .	86.55191040696656
 I 'm just thinking of a way for you to be sensible .	236.2694771525549
 I 'm sorry .	744.4311847731293
 I do seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think of a way to make a little extra money .	213.25008139744838
 Well , let 's see .	336.9786208294446
 Let 's make a list of your assets .	318.28777850829135
 Maggie started laughing , and she laughed so hard she could n't stop , and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining .	539.7811142182626
 When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures .	314.0550160895125
 I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers , Eugenia said .	343.35395252203926
 We could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it 's nice and sunny , but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that .	363.3604531500044
 What else ?	561.8210104137448
 You might set up a dress shop in the living room .	361.8500755475261
 Every woman in the block has tried that .	416.4536425103057
 What about a tea room , then ?	305.16814889280425
 You could set up tables in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread and Grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes .	491.97684163904415
 It 's too elaborate .	336.0982496590323
 And Grandma is n't strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am I .	314.03420421265196
 Eugenia sighed .	312.83443535474186
 She said , Well , those are the really interesting things , but if you do n't like any of those I can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough .	401.55371492985563
 Oh , I 'm sure I could do that , Maggie said .	200.18982872055554
 But it really would n't be fair , taking your jobs away from you .	467.53464757882153
 Do n't worry , I can get plenty more , Eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could .	400.2416284805691
 Maggie was looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be brushing up on her typing so Eugenia would n't be ashamed of it .	216.848549065136
 And then whenever I have a minute I can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time .	213.0168908112836
 And I can go back to my contests and be thinking while I 'm doing the washing .	473.04208358940673
 What are you going to do with your feet so you do n't waste anything ?	734.8184942074104
 Maggie laughed .	128.39673818274525
 She said , Oh Eugenia , I wish h What ?	330.41096763366363
 I wish I had three wishes , Maggie said .	232.4137786949784
 All of them for you .	168.00832686858033
 It grew bitterly cold toward the end of November , contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people .	317.1734712308871
 The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days .	491.81684187337504
 The cold settled like a tangible pall over the Mile High City , locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance ; it had a look of grim stark realism , resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold , instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy Western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources .	409.8893507282293
 The jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies .	827.9579828041691
 There were n't facilities to take care of them ; there never had been a need felt for such facilities .	291.54334885116293
 That kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight rates .	302.75635306112923
 The East was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay .	635.1228870259995
 The government offices were being opened but they were n't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything .	1225.6907412120036
 Shivering , people talked and argued ; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate remedies and something had to be done .	496.2120398887868
 Something had to be done ; it was the theme song of millions of American people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government .	368.235851744809
 Something had to be done .	140.593982331324
 The Abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day .	230.31383601618987
 Something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half soles , for overshoes , for clothes , for the new leaks in the roof , for gas and light bills ; about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once , twice , fifty times a day .	352.97928532918513
 Just dropping the baby 's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster .	874.7960815000404
 The Abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold .	509.099938355437
 Cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up , under doors , around loosened window frames , from the sleeping porches , the attic , from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof .	174.5904598994813
 Presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the fireplaces and an electric heater in Grandma 's room .	324.8486733179981
 It was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them , like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive .	261.3310100740421
 The pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms .	409.274452144144
 They lived mainly in the kitchen ; they moved Maggie 's bed and the baby 's basket there , and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds .	314.98252031884186
 Grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to .	302.14862659973784
 You said a mouthful , Eugenia said grimly .	45.76354760756318
 Eugenia hated being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin .	757.5439982212391
 She said to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever .	169.70969375395563
 Plenty of people are poor all their lives .	351.40208055594024
 Plenty of people have n't our brains and talent .	408.3313514206776
 I know you when you start talking about brains and talent , Maggie said .	511.95108420289665
 You 're working up to something , and if you do n't watch out you 'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the Abernathy family is superior to everything , even a depression .	457.270104649499
 The only thing that worries me is how I 'm going to prove it , Eugenia said .	339.1214518890913
 They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way .	325.25735646860136
 She did n't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater .	443.839002127156
 Hope would n't hear of it , and she took the heater back to Grandma 's room , and Grandma took it back to Hope 's room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire .	201.37014626039613
 She said that proved she was n't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it .	266.8447850423134
 Eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma would n't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in .	552.7443481063599
 Thrifty of her to use it up .	107.47980949337799
 Unusual in a case like this , but- You can joke !	301.87215385951555
 Did n't you read it ?	724.3226162876537
 She 's married that tenant !	231.59209650069565
 I read it , yes .	165.19341456118653
 This ought to simplify Tolley 's life .	251.3158072740434
 Laban had more to say .	67.325101665132
 Tolley had gone to live in California .	147.4762670950157
 He 'd mentioned it , himself , at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that Tolley had left because Jenny had jilted him for Roy robards .	174.3826641980642
 It was plain as the nose on your face that they 're laughing about it , Mamma .	388.2958098055907
 Zion stayed to get my pin , but it 'll be a cold day in June when I go back .	283.7992010060766
 We will both go back , Laban !	210.94863300365577
 Kizzie turned to go inside .	164.88572924989776
 Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , Mamma .	744.4838952529591
 The sun 's right- Pictures ?	65.16248617001736
 She swung around .	663.2406318558025
 What pictures ?	1108.1359548328373
 In Brace 's room !	151.190986470674
 You told me to bring my camera .	513.2889806926728
 I 'm not going back- Indeed you are !	747.2809376561167
 Why should I want pictures of an empty room now ?	1089.8218734489587
 Tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little Jenny !	71.89972824227902
 This- trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants , and I am going to see that everybody at Mt Pleasant understands that simple fact .	233.10462413595548
 Wait for me , Laban , I 'll be dressed in half a second !	335.20167535729996
 Frank followed her into the bedroom , hooked her dress up the back .	441.2273618169358
 Hurry , Frank !	224.24653410711426
 They 're not going to laugh at the Fairbrothers and Labans very long !	208.3152275162139
 Tolley 's going is my fault .	331.33557835817726
 I drove him away .	183.5975050759643
 You know it and I 'll tell everybody exactly how it happened .	630.8606031192618
 She was so beautiful , so valiant , so pitiable .	68.38796169388084
 He kissed her .	54.492406808957256
 Make your confession to God , Kizzie dear , not to the congregation .	374.5715459433493
 I 'll decide that when I get there .	291.993666527838
 I was so cruel to Tolley , so unfair .	158.21088035593334
 But I 'll be fair now !	368.17139318535686
 He is coming back , is n't he , Frank ?	207.96988940450078
 Yes , oh yes .	833.0896914690215
 What else was there to say ?	192.58482040405448
 Returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from Jonathan Swift on his lips Under the window in stormy weather I marry this man and woman together .	481.02800564251686
 Let none but Him who rules the thunder Put this man and woman asunder .	1251.167728855267
 Absolution for his lie ?	180.57343928048186
 He questioned God 's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about Kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole , wondering why he had preserved it .	307.4732921359942
 If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it .	429.3943173585811
 In any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons , making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own .	408.1934556984394
 It was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing .	363.5696555281594
 You 've told God , Frank , he said .	323.14521404377416
 Why lacerate the- congregation ?	401.96371640129934
 Reaching for an old clay pot , relic of pioneer days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little pyre to flame , watching it curl , the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash .	390.57851122458663
 Surely now his beloved son could rest in peace .	576.1294322876744
 'And let me go , for the night gathers me , and in the night shall no man gather fruit ' .	321.7309361105075
 A beautiful and haunting line , a subtle genius , Swinburne , difficult not to envy a gifted man , and perhaps he did h. But there were great satisfactions , even for a small man .	209.62043966432972
 Beyond his window were the greening trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal life .	587.0085168697797
 There lay Grand Fair 's Quinzaine , his own young parents ' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , grandsons .	306.82011197909617
 He poured his thimble of wine for the toast he 'd made so often .	333.7654022052414
 To absent loved ones .	2095.807798131271
 But this last time he drank not to Brace but To Tolley !	193.8394904535959
 42 MR ROBARDS- Jenny was the only person she knew of in the Mt Pleasant neighborhood who called him that- was kind but too easygoing .	416.94859015136245
 It did n't bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say , Howdy , Miss Jenny , adding a careless Roy , but it did her .	168.6713656591368
 He could put a stop to it , she told him again and again .	165.78866878836342
 Simply call Mr Whipsnade Oscar , and Dr Dunne PG , and C'un Major Frank .	207.4143746092971
 Mr Robards laughed , said he 'd feel a damn fool , plain-out could n't do that even to please her .	474.4910748157733
 You could try .	260.1485186377202
 And if I ever hear you say 'Mist Laban ' again I 'll scream .	557.4848435452119
 And do n't tell me you did n't at church Sunday .	620.2994338198529
 I heard you !	320.8193712408136
 He really had n't meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr Robards .	200.38574033002294
 How strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in- spiritual ways .	392.6763350139644
 Another weakness- far more irritating than his manner of speaking , which he made only token effort to change- was his devotion to that old horse of Tolley 's .	290.46070021007097
 Her horse , rather .	687.1027780780911
 But Mr Robards ' now , oh my yes , indeed , yes !	470.3406692466695
 He called her the Mare much as Mrs Whipsnade spoke of the Queen , God bless her .	317.9677045141038
 h He , with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there in the barn , was reverent only of the Mare , the Racin ' Mare , the revolting Gunny .	91.36427833187913
 For the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny , going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall .	317.30562070039156
 And what had happened ?	209.50375111732703
 Gunny invariably tried to bite her .	675.6944772542763
 Nerves , Mr Robards said , just a nip anyway .	79.10936232861904
 Stand back , Miss Jen , she 's oneasy of your scarf .	60.714199891426404
 Never , Quit that , you sor'l devil !	240.68817049224972
 Never concern for his wife 's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January .	794.4429997471302
 She mus n't annoy Gunny whose foal was due then too !	212.83630664054922
 Listening for hours to his laments that the war and Mist Fair 's poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph , and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come , Jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it .	291.1421216877978
 Gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant- Tolley , the indifference with which the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her disgusting swollen stomach .	308.374797852176
 Human birth was no novelty to Mr Robards .	570.2471551387598
 Tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick , he suggested .	150.81785779653714
 Jenny 's aversion to having Dr Dunne , a former admirer , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her .	263.29833462313394
 The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure .	361.34429872923613
 He would be in the barn , or riding for the veterinarian !	93.4961544322836
 Night after night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter , rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment , fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe , tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house .	224.2446615548114
 Yet when the dear baby came , he had Tillie over here in a jiffy , and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been .	175.87552192030432
 Jenny wished now that she had had Dr Dunne , feeling that somehow he would n't have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets .	333.39887212408667
 There was something not nice about triplets , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they had n't been the son he wanted , saying , You do n't see triplets trippin ' down the pike ever ' day , Miss Jen , hon .	263.180205673539
 Rhyme 'em up cute- Arcilla , Flotilla h Edmonia for her mother , she said firmly , Jennifer , for herself , and- Kezziah , for Miss Kizzie , he suggested .	139.29124228260167
 She was mighty good to you past times , an ' this 'll fetch her .	522.6037909240436
 Now she must be thinking of a boy-name , something special .	163.58713819413853
 Just wait till she saw the Mare 's foal .	242.20306409041635
 Handsomest colt in all Kentucky .	378.50304399221596
 Strong too , up on his legs when he was an hour old .	387.29121603653016
 What about Royal Robards ?	467.02459339721395
 Why do n't you name him Jesus Christ !	1533.582587551719
 She burst into tears .	1198.150571406811
 Roy was deeply distressed .	315.71279764708345
 He 'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been .	434.7113608234046
 Of course she was n't herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits did n't seem to rise with it .	537.2847100842945
 He had a good idea why not .	202.72825951364334
 Those elegant At Home cards she sent out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all trimmed up , had n't brought many callers in two whole months .	623.2780312638411
 Doc Dunne and Miss Sis had come .	65.53882391606358
 So had Miss Shawnee Rakestraw , full of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his Heavenly Rest last year , saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town in inclement weather , was looking forward to Quinzaine Spa this summer .	418.4414145235059
 There was an idea .	64.78065677627397
 Miss Kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married , though you 'd have thought a namesake would have brought her round .	408.015395653335
 Oh , she 'd come to see them once , left silver teething rings for all of the trips .	245.87333912771945
 But when Miss Jen went over right away to return the call , Miss Kiz could n't have been very cordial , for she 'd come back before she hardly had time to get there .	439.28126022941404
 More and more , these days , she 'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to Tillie 's and Nick's- his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and pups under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies .	500.54286442586647
 Though he was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too .	333.694160282102
 It made him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea Miss Sis had given him , to be told by Miss Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain Mrs Robards and the children .	273.5844723306761
 She hoped they were well .	370.9485259100408
 He did n't tell Miss Jen , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those Quinzaine nigs , and she really took a fit .	279.4124126114374
 If he ever did such a thing again she 'd die of shame .	644.4684455081252
 Have a party an ' leave 'em out , hon , he suggested .	502.27339118154714
 A swell party , send an invite to ever'body but them- those folks you met at the Galt House , the ones I 've got to know in this new Jockey Club affair , the whole dang neighborhood .	451.8446583315511
 We 'll have oystchers- couple bar'l oystchers 'll fetch in a crowd any time .	211.0494156000141
 I 'll see word gets round .	1073.6852560275688
 Do n't you dare !	1113.1954805733978
 Miss Jen was funny that way , funny that she did n't seem to take to his ideas and perk up .	259.260515356328
 He was downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try h. Zion was surprised when Roy 's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town .	585.7355027177301
 Roy smiled- he did have a nice smile- took off his hat most politely , told her to hop in , and he 'd give her a lift to Quinzaine .	276.3287102202412
 Her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he did n't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on .	655.7903467583748
 See for yourself , Miss Zion .	324.0967276436915
 It wo n't take a minute .	448.7569320476992
 He swung in through his own wide gateway .	206.77869288765714
 Them 's the purtiest babes you ever did see , but Miss Jen gets mighty lonesome .	200.46099583949191
 She 'll relish the sight of a friendly face .	460.9116592950596
 Miss Kiz wo n't care your comin ' , will she ?	759.8842093066523
 Why of course not , Zion said uncomfortably .	129.37994680592948
 He must have forgiven me , Henrietta murmured to the room .	464.8231532574471
 The absolution of Doaty 's last will and testament was proof enough of that ; Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman .	213.47265102448932
 She found herself wishing an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin .	478.912065252561
 Perhaps Doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel .	283.69910583037176
 Henrietta thought , It 's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us .	828.7469701391005
 There had been more to know about Hetty , inevitably , and most of it unfavorable .	91.08188794232673
 Adelia was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted .	173.98883399251585
 Their childhood would have been quite circumspect without Hetty 's flair for drama , especially through the long summers .	377.42210253919205
 In winter , in the city , there had been the Maneret School , which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge ; there had been lessons in French from a small Polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; there had been the dancing class- Miss Craddock , thin and tireless , with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three , one-two-three .	214.7074988683414
 There had been supper parties and teas , fetes and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the Blackwell planets revolved .	296.4047590580194
 Mama had died before the corruption of the family circle , the interruption of Charles .	298.8728782679052
 It was safe to assume that Papa , sighing heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , Thank God your poor mother was spared this , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in Charles ' hand , just because her poor mother was gone already and would never know .	440.3366987039845
 Mama was vulnerable ; one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her .	474.13838576807467
 But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta .	545.0014196347108
 She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .	287.75191220084776
 Only at this moment- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty 's bed- she found herself examining how others might regard her .	626.5857116191326
 Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice .	621.85481080852
 She turned on her side , finding the idea oppressive .	219.62245850721092
 If Adelia had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run away with him ?	478.88174218589785
 Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone .	353.71470784146715
 No temptation , no sin .	381.3195326794838
 No temptation , no virtue ?	641.3357695801905
 A curious thought to end a curious night .	632.0017404960578
 The birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all of Doaty 's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf .	359.6137909504635
 Before anything else , she would go to Doaty 's grave with flowers from Doaty 's forgotten garden .	399.5679078327751
 Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards .	680.5531365131166
 She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls .	1281.8573498120406
 It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray .	176.2692168760611
 After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .	502.772763371871
 The garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness .	150.46659678499915
 Leaning out , she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it .	135.59439874023926
 On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song .	372.36537479836335
 It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age .	299.72757743937484
 Feeling suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs .	431.1148868705371
 Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human .	116.87504173992897
 Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .	358.3181453185794
 Outside , the garden , the tame wilderness , yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies , sweet william , scented stock and lady 's bedstraw , which she tied with long grasses and took back to show Rosa , who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing Folly .	136.61795036621393
 The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws .	63.1422864540246
 Henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for Doaty .	226.44810160936493
 Rummaging in the dew , said Rosa coldly .	20.490612272554184
 Go change your shoes before you turn around .	2124.561558274027
 She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home .	928.2047016752073
 Folly danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door .	597.6884255336355
 To a Blackwell , there was only one church .	73.95747544592327
 The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea .	163.96502518885424
 For the first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity .	406.08802235086233
 She smiled and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child .	508.51508259946894
 Now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested .	119.79072600584965
 An old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than reflective look as she passed , the sap still plainly rising in his branches .	357.963664698633
 On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning .	450.27898973304013
 He cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition , announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time .	186.70518940250614
 He then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was unenthusiastic .	105.3762047450394
 Summer 's been slow to come , he said .	107.87847335418424
 It 's my dryin ' out time .	176.04376627028228
 He scowled at her flowers .	88.87245054782329
 I 'm taking them to the cemetery , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality .	355.277709851496
 They 'll be takin ' me next , he said pleasantly , but not so soon 's they plan .	298.46986047543396
 See half of 'em in their graves before I choose my own coffin .	338.92189741660786
 It 's dryin ' myself out that does it .	153.98382513062964
 He regarded her with rising hope .	588.2734562992833
 You 'd like to hear how I go about it .	385.3199250270566
 It 's nice of you , Henrietta said doubtfully .	246.82780760212154
 Y 're welcome .	3692.045610404297
 He straightened himself , soldierly against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots .	392.23581683188644
 His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text .	247.37413038070477
 Every month , f'r three days , he said happily , I take no water into my system , no water whatsoever .	239.03247028151583
 It rests the tissues .	395.1559991649856
 Henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense .	628.2993945903909
 Rests the tissues , he said , and pacifies the system .	52.52299193241585
 My dad did it , and he lived to a great age .	86.99733037718973
 He looked up at her sharply .	155.18036900196375
 Do n't remember , do you ?	432.48795132666663
 She did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old Titus , who must have been in his nineties when Henrietta ran away .	205.12178564181298
 Next to the Blackwells , Titus had owned the island most , and she and Adelia had often stood in front of him , silenced by his terrible years- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner , more aged than possible .	232.98815868118857
 He had never spoken once to the awed sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea .	232.75760283078125
 It must be that son who sat before her now , shriveled to half his size and half his senses .	300.64532132181773
 She said gently , Of course I remember you .	943.6700392187066
 Not so well 's I remember you , he said .	238.2078697376629
 Y 're the young Blackwell woman .	491.12211691440257
 Ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man .	100.75941197378934
 I know all about you .	170.90515156375858
 You do seem to , said Henrietta , impressed .	583.2364442857598
 Ca n't blame a man for leavin ' his wife , he said quite cheerfully .	155.0919168394528
 Left mine many a time , only she never knew it .	561.3895999986482
 Man in a boat , there 's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit .	267.6997984909457
 Any harm in that ?	946.4405002665942
 Probably , said Henrietta dryly .	345.3921530685395
 He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly .	264.09901404464335
 You 'd be the one to say , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were different , since all actions had their own laws .	486.5574409423308
 Only , this old man 's connivance was even less to her taste than Selma Cotter 's open censure .	181.7459630878064
 Well , she had not come back to Great Island to be understood , praised or condemned .	312.04410620276343
 She had come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow .	196.39061624106992
 She started to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a big-boned , drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress .	237.02324155507614
 She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man .	605.7053879271674
 You 've not had your breakfast yet , gran'dad .	414.0054774835692
 Y'r dam ' porridge is no breakfast , he said .	191.92910841996124
 Milk and sops !	638.738358874772
 He beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones .	117.75741292740916
 He 's owly today , his grand-daughter said wearily , and bent to pick it up .	90.74931465961221
 He 's got this idea about drying out h It ai n't an idea !	934.9310236848119
 If it ai n't an idea , she said , how comes it you can drink beer but not water ?	584.6900059789126
 He looked piously to heaven and said , Beer do n't affect the tissues none , and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence .	327.9980909707559
 His grand-daughter sighed .	226.64282652541704
 Come on , do .	756.8628947921409
 The children are eating , and Miss Blackwell 's on her way somewheres .	161.75406143758056
 To the graveyard .	198.42536672467838
 Who ai n't ?	2934.5879607423067
 Not me .	230.95674774748537
 I 've got a day 's work to do.- You 'll be visiting Miss Doaty , ma'am ?	327.5181251773638
 Henrietta nodded .	5264.394519188615
 How much they knew about her !	498.30591098809083
 The woman she must have been a tiny baby when Hetty and Delia had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small answered the nod with her own .	753.1244917412646
 God rest her soul , she was a sweet one .	633.845529418527
 Come on now .	686.3253650116898
 She put a strong hand under the old man 's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old .	383.3508121178548
 He mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength .	374.5909816202213
 There was a gabble of voices from indoors , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of swearing from the old man .	349.3924013346852
 Henrietta looked down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on their journey 's way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , Folly dancing ahead of her .	369.10463384991743
 At the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , dotted with fat round bushes like sheep .	580.8503319752035
 They were covered with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots clawing at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry .	286.454097929905
 The air was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky .	255.6318216592978
 She felt mindless , walking , and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty .	462.0576919294921
 Both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them how many things had lessened while she was gone away but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named Dorothy Tredding seemed suddenly impossible .	829.3290247194683
 She sat down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with sea-damp , her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss .	444.0611593546837
 The day 's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her parasol , if only to shade Doaty 's flowers .	382.19278035756975
 A small , rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery .	478.6707653111428
 She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts .	355.3062666314989
 The Momoyama family had come from Miyagi Prefecture , in the northeast of the main Japanese island of Honshu , where there are still traces of the mysterious Ainu strain .	168.20608316877033
 The Ainus were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal ancestors of the Japanese came from Southern Asia .	237.5717210095928
 Apparently they were of Caucasian blood .	219.84842010349504
 They had white skins and blue eyes ; all their men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful .	498.40715756731134
 A pitiful few of them are left now , to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants , which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the American Indians .	161.03655237058337
 Most of them have been assimilated , but sometimes a man in Miyagi or Akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average Japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the South .	161.14907771301708
 Tommy Momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions .	456.11336673069394
 She was taller than most Japanese girls , and had the exquisitely willowy form of the Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall .	213.66679941591497
 Her nose was higher of bridge , her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn , and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong .	369.7156815033723
 Her mouth , soft and full , was something for any man to dream about .	533.0108207539421
 She had black eyes , long and intriguingly tilted , and the way she walked was melody .	313.09035809200253
 She had been in Japan just one week .	407.7889590971148
 It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at San Diego , Bremerton , the Great Lakes , Pensacola- any place the Navy had a hospital- with a threat to resign her commission if the	349.13089035766734
372.3392684145832
