 You mean dream ?	3548.1546925469297
 Not exactly .	702.7333776215428
 Just see it .	208.9778505360291
 Benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble .	392.9237862076745
 Nope , just you , all the time- sometimes I think it 's the only way I 'll ever get a decent partner .	445.62422911533
 Ramey smiled but he thought to himself , I always see me too .	235.43840075297678
 Never Benny .	169.67262417413977
 Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt , Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind .	384.33711153288357
 Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think .	304.69428168570136
 With this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down .	183.48603138053207
 You seen him yet ?	668.4029114574897
 Benson said , referring to the Indian .	100.21087227861574
 He was n't in the car , Ramey said .	49.05496952423948
 You did n't go clear around , Benson said .	226.75918032046172
 If you want to see something , he 's back on the other side by the trunk of the car .	101.27656999246456
 Too long a waiting line , Ramey answered , pretending to joke .	689.2041556722761
 A few minutes later the insurance man , a road checker , drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state .	225.999382111669
 It was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed .	670.9563614974396
 Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed .	322.55668397106194
 All the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges , the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane .	874.8873037143957
 Horsely , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist .	281.94076308256024
 It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist , an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head .	309.22284488701496
 The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men 's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town .	317.3387206472636
 He chatted with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer .	79.55968247084343
 Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear .	415.685854925885
 When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer .	182.83498697181477
 There 's a body you wo n't mind looking at , Benson said and they stopped .	421.87721792241956
 She had driven up with her husband in a convertible with Eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that .	644.403696895694
 She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt .	389.44045306905264
 Slender and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply .	317.3850007829403
 What outfit does she drive for ?	2866.1650633681065
 Benson said .	36.84012961320638
 Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey , a recognition .	145.1292208731464
 She might have been someone he had once loved .	467.5485356079881
 He had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run .	140.49912563696657
 The truck routes , the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay .	530.185901746692
 How would you ever see her again ?	568.644720645976
 The feeling subsided , it was only a small yearning .	130.55314635952115
 Their work was lonely .	465.38930522188747
 What 's she doing in this bunch ?	549.461827547003
 Benson said , and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been .	303.35928022661534
 The girl looked around at the countryside .	295.7956915071361
 Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing .	1453.6284435083176
 It made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on .	396.79725508955767
 She began to watch a blonde-haired man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly .	231.03118829176572
 What had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but Benson knew what it was .	420.33480852864136
 The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson , in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real , said , You do n't want to go around there , Ma'am .	226.5414639396881
 The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her .	677.2057887743834
 The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car .	462.92105286244833
 The two drivers moved closer .	839.6032415237283
 What does he want , a spoon ?	283.16929880061406
 Benson said to Ramey .	29.99363649000245
 One tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain .	311.7280179298852
 With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian 's foot that he would always remember .	333.48063810584574
 The laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top .	98.70481702014956
 The slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside .	306.7958755215548
 The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man .	108.08872379380938
 He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows .	266.95100902546534
 He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes .	279.4981194584533
 He was very tanned- big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster .	141.02254404037203
 He 's dead , is n't he ?	125.41240515819668
 the man said .	181.01672834197382
 He turned and bent over the body of the Indian .	141.3789523228743
 There was nothing in particular on the man 's face .	119.73302366745398
 It was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine .	190.71268474349378
 What 's this ?	268.6542507552368
 the man said , backing up a step , still looking down .	346.97900966534
 His words were mostly to himself .	294.3701951947923
 Do n't .	475.0480148565684
 There was a gentle concern in Benson 's voice .	134.14275901563232
 Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man 's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded , blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement .	193.34655626509715
 But what is it ?	130.9476476214328
 the man said with a tone of impatience .	306.989625964169
 But what is it ?	130.84272531510925
 The man had spoken only once .	266.7464616639766
 Ramey heard the words again inside , weakened , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears .	334.2123677018462
 The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey 's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man 's leg .	230.20628332725303
 Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin .	900.6091708161516
 He stared at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , Do n't do that , fella .	410.54084781169576
 Them 's brains .	154.69131609392463
 The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist .	406.4294551179445
 Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth .	201.52705342321613
 It was a straight , solid , once-in-a-lifetime shot ; he laid all four knuckles in between the man 's cheekbone and his chin .	279.82110804457704
 Ramey 's fist and the air expelled from the man 's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together .	263.7026120258501
 The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement .	524.6924854361955
 Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand .	308.84675778737676
 As he watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet .	475.5678139799896
 He had n't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard .	439.1242379266657
 With a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him .	199.80416577656206
 His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open .	325.74668674262915
 After what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it .	786.4930833851105
 The man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth .	392.86403403703684
 He moaned and pulled the hand away .	112.16903154250463
 Even yet there was no realization in his eyes .	217.94108147409497
 Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him .	484.60529900652705
 He did not look around .	169.94662900614637
 What happened ?	452.4389452400177
 someone said .	582.5815670848951
 He 's hurt !	413.0625036702397
 A woman 's voice said , and then he heard a sort of wail from the man 's wife .	123.8087964501208
 The man on the ground began to move ; one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him .	184.954201258762
 Blood dripped down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright V woven into the neckline had melted , running a darker color .	346.19421632649784
 The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back .	262.46472443941906
 Can you hear , can you talk to me ?	600.7166328369775
 she begged .	112.61055859643952
 An incoherent , puzzled sound came from the red mouth .	316.96996869133676
 The girl looked around quickly at several of the people .	300.50734840914396
 None of the crowd had stepped forward to help .	681.6787632761258
 Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment .	96.83891306854156
 Why did you do it- why did you hit him ?	901.6295270741281
 she said , her voice rising .	663.8308336670776
 Ramey said nothing .	114.20188995664112
 A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again .	463.0121900850287
 Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers .	877.2650800382374
 No one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out .	397.20586564241745
 Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman .	249.2562339472576
 Benson moved his arms , gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly .	460.2288109791775
 Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man .	180.32648189992653
 Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey .	96.33765722035916
 It 's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them .	334.71486233799214
 Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer .	220.5088065851121
 He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman 's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol .	248.839271769145
 All right , step back !	589.5432140957334
 the patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis .	247.78058038303283
 He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him .	256.0800106417487
 You all right ?	673.0286918179672
 Mough- it 's my mough , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips .	201.66341617704506
 His brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it .	619.0114364817418
 Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head- caught in the wicker back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute .	204.69433391684368
 The body continued to lash , but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome , bloody mass out of the bungalow .	103.37797457774059
 He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots .	137.08182241851907
 He heard their chattering , and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes .	212.64743777057691
 It was only then that he turned to look at Penny .	95.179030265473
 She was sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her .	172.98366432848306
 The fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth .	248.94151572081387
 But her hands were calm , now .	214.2797606593975
 She 's got guts , thought Keith .	92.62380134662072
 She 's got more guts than any other woman in the world .	195.3062719016739
 Keith , said Penny , Keith , you were wonderful .	61.77581937209524
 I do n't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am .	494.31365939840293
 Thank you , Keith .	30.91057924841313
 He smiled at her sincerity .	361.70950235519047
 And for the hundredth time that week , he was startled at her beauty .	91.33296002947398
 Strange .	22.35421370775354
 Seven years they 'd been married .	1210.0566262009957
 He knew her mind pretty well , by now , its quick perceptions and sympathies , its painful insistence on truth and directness , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate , even in part .	428.99804277209125
 But her beauty always surprised him anew .	1360.2456629647913
 I realize that this is hardly the time to say it , Penny , said Keith .	112.14518759856217
 But knowing you , I know that you 're glad to be alive , and grateful- and sorry because I killed the snake , even though I had to .	336.20731876968915
 Is n't that so ?	356.9618556459223
 Penny lowered her eyes .	386.0308626640081
 Yes , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime .	174.39556089960146
 The snake was beautiful , was n't it ?	226.67912844640932
 asked Keith , his voice getting harsher in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger .	343.42822394931414
 It was a king cobra , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , did n't it ?	155.87772294964157
 DID N'T IT ?	2621.839998795423
 Penny did not answer .	105.03891339547452
 Now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him .	438.7929634485087
 We 're all God 's creatures , are n't we ?	489.81102953549066
 Keith was snarling now .	26.92249466888815
 All of us- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle .	76.73158605397234
 You love this village and these stinking brown people because they 're God 's creatures , too .	748.8516526840702
 And you love Ahmiri , that black bastard of a servant even a little more , because he 's a beautiful man .	316.6260579807284
 And he loves you because you 're a beautiful woman .	496.1841105403134
 We 're all God 's creatures , are n't we , Penny ?	282.2775325946725
 All of us , that is , except me .	166.17138627276324
 You hate me , you hate my guts , because I like to hunt .	457.79079052476015
 You actually hate me- and we both know it- because I killed that filthy snake .	1331.50494949193
 h Well , why do n't you say something ?	807.432134071128
 Penny would not rise to his mood .	142.37386995659116
 There is n't anything left to say , is there , Keith ?	123.51015600448872
 She softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader .	300.43866118990644
 He knew she was not sulking , not even angry at him .	117.79825406552958
 Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him .	387.2281776696803
 The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world , the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet .	88.68073665112112
 For a brief period each year , the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls , and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon , and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long , meandering journey to the sea- running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga , then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam , past the Khasi Hills , and into Bengal , past Sirinjani and Madaripur , until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal .	210.08862096086813
 Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space .	408.2836443865317
 But Keith looked down more than up .	162.05883840475687
 He thought of the jungles below him , and of the wild , strange , untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the lords .	192.00812031785085
 At first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war .	311.68910416401553
 But after the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself .	204.35496061062656
 Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves .	226.67822682152266
 And Keith 's record of kills made him a man to listen to- a man paradoxically , who might even survive .	414.0518185428627
 He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates .	187.99971665390805
 The RAF was Britain 's weapon of attrition , and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war .	376.8341681979612
 He knew how to shoot down Nazis .	670.1591840546556
 And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it- because he was chemically incapable of fear .	249.92095059696703
 That was true , but only half the truth .	151.82236918734606
 The other half he did n't like to recognize , even to himself .	223.9251697882467
 He enjoyed the killing .	263.0837459519914
 Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity .	841.192854284968
 He enjoyed killing .	940.9392483357398
 And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi .	237.90420809561917
 Nowadays , we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish .	96.13564423739244
 The Nazis bombed Britain , so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down .	155.549452374993
 Not quite .	683.6753801308552
 It was a war of nerves , of stamina , of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis , who were better organized and technically superior .	327.92290579127115
 It took a long time before the British tipped the balance .	162.35769935446928
 Keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be risked .	293.84120414108975
 They grounded him over his protests- not including his true reason for wanting to fly and put him in the Command offices .	323.7698528741042
 That was where he met Penny .	111.91258003663802
 He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , regardless of how important she might have thought she was in the Command offices , but that was all .	249.38187375459714
 Penny knew him better , on her part .	162.19644396586656
 He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals .	183.93782236388017
 They do n't go for bull-like muscle , as a rule .	189.83445657528395
 He had strength in his six-foot frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier .	73.43995306428175
 He was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep .	92.09938700959086
 His hair was black , already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom , the only one permitted to a man .	101.84880600559306
 The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles- and Penny , hating the cliche , had to admit that in this case it applied .	124.56139345311553
 Keith was an eagle .	20.32946163490827
 Penny and Keith had no romance .	75.11929583402906
 No dates or hand-holding .	169.0626477496867
 But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly .	408.33312697978073
 The Command offices were in the border country , up north , where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports , and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy .	481.4869546439882
 The Nazis knew this , of course , and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit .	396.0934127084777
 This time , they had been lucky .	147.49088620287978
 The Command post was underground , and well camouflaged .	278.13651253647936
 But there had n't been enough time to build it for keeps .	319.65856376989046
 There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as efficacious , when a direct hit comes along .	496.0593776872805
 This one was actually more of a near miss .	350.7608974198497
 The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post , but not precisely into the Command room itself .	425.70565513786516
 There was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks , as ordered .	225.57691091165069
 That is , everyone but Keith and Penny .	72.24152161734948
 They stood there , just the two of them , in the rocking , shattering blast .	122.25023395792236
 Keith was on his feet because he did n't care at all about life any more Penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much .	376.65976636632695
 The bomb was a solitary one .	228.42661475835442
 The blast damaged , but did not destroy the room .	332.0939940351985
 Keith 's eyes met Penny 's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction .	450.2121246705067
 And , as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his .	228.80714547132706
 The chaplain married them , on the next day .	81.03568003860464
 After the war , Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her .	199.0725593935308
 She came from Ohio , from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres , as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers .	377.3630312368604
 But to Keith 's London-bred mind , such acreage sounded rather invincible .	257.3243326901658
 It was n't that , however , which decided them not to go to America .	153.28671192925677
 Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma .	258.285205879248
 He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles .	87.06583673616292
 He did n't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself .	494.723673374476
 He could n't stop killing .	468.39125695183947
 That was his true love , not Penny .	90.58484039500529
 The terrible power of a gun , the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose .	193.61917388967652
 And in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing .	251.03090866498442
 When they got to Shillong , in Assam , he was happy .	67.65229753807117
 This is a paradise for hunters .	118.42479717459499
 This was the land of the sladang , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread .	275.7918361697836
 The great black leopards .	91.29465311156446
 The sambur buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk .	70.858752195158
 He even hunted elephant , although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin .	575.9682956096179
 But there are big rogues in both countries .	210.79324475468854
 These were the ones Keith sought out- the loners , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself .	210.0938165763049
 He and Penny would go out on tame elephants , raised from babyhood in the keddah .	75.80803089527915
 And while he was ever alert for game , and most particularly a tiger , Penny marvelled at the Eden they were traversing .	240.62581030134834
 They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools .	370.22462242766534
 Peacocks strutted across their path , preening .	76.03909596524637
 There were fantastic flowers without perfume , and gaudy birds without song .	815.2967171338896
 Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close .	502.4595165339023
 Wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted derision when they did n't consider such game worthy of a shot from the .404 's .	223.3313461175197
 Now , the next morning , they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms , with the weighted line beside it ; and Robinson Roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface .	359.2922425204065
 He and his safety man , Herr Schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together .	147.20840211970938
 The German courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first .	946.0516999994044
 Robinson clambered heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his triple-tank assembly .	544.0162711493591
 He was frowning .	12.32182690306897
 He took his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck .	209.21047759659945
 Temper , temper , Mrs Forsythe said , laughing uneasily .	176.24322753804492
 A phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty , but irreparably stringy in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and tonic , though it was not yet ten AM I loused it , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice .	342.0798374037609
 All I have to do to set the record is to go on down .	210.01736234806083
 So instead I come up .	375.31024806088794
 Was it my equipment ?	1477.0774447789715
 the German asked .	609.1383705004033
 Was it something went bad with the breathing ?	1123.0051869620606
 The equipment was fine , Rob stated , standing up .	408.019044446221
 He was a huge young man of twenty-four , clothed in muscle , immensely strong , with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation .	246.69654473060956
 He stared stonily at the floor .	72.30466668484641
 I was down to 275 .	42.429847760878054
 I 've been that far half a dozen times .	642.8080873474847
 I do n't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick .	791.6206212992176
 Well , I get it , Artie said , still on the ladder .	88.19680679272952
 You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record .	301.70058177425665
 And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself .	480.32591047888656
 So you turn around .	537.7033439337634
 No , it was n't that , Rob said .	186.92842901589626
 A note of awe came into his voice .	360.55094316701224
 When I came up , damnit , I thought I was going down .	106.9875301177709
 I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening .	790.7233699139802
 Pressure-happy , Artie said , and climbed in .	74.79378138498265
 That 's right , Robinson said .	205.02539755037577
 I was expecting it , sure .	180.65884250310847
 But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you 're a hundred feet from where you thought you were- well , it makes you think .	316.90868089008126
 You do n't head back down again .	373.4295924349696
 Not me , anyway .	414.1259702802577
 Not right away .	365.5266056778223
 He had his voice under control again no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him .	350.94933853268606
 Waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat .	104.56693394749051
 Now he was going to show how much he knew .	222.66697745793587
 Our boy did n't chicken out , no sir .	606.0365909690756
 He ran into the rapture of the depths .	50.485100339987895
 Nitrogen narcosis .	14.008821977642663
 It makes the diver feel drunk .	227.30849058569805
 Well , that 's the only way to be , Mrs Forsythe said , and gave her brassy laugh .	165.21358130902243
 Maybe not , if you 're 200 feet under water , Artie said .	453.52343123638735
 Anyway , Waddell went on .	76.2775237671308
 it 's nothing to fool with .	834.2880786400517
 It can kill you .	283.5570552261851
 Personally , I do n't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story .	280.2526490117084
 Nobody 's giving anything up , Robinson said .	755.7475611749601
 He stood there , towering over them all gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; and yet like a child among adults .	366.6182697938315
 You think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ?	403.16642570348375
 I 'm going down again .	303.6800247411734
 That 's my boy !	452.98200654135957
 Mr Forsythe exclaimed .	314.83000393189707
 Rob 's not going to give up as easy as all that .	679.7588040100012
 He was a florid , puffy man in his early sixties , very natty in his yachting cap , striped jacket and white flannels .	96.34344659166496
 He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of Commodore was never used without irony .	386.0842490157644
 Old Commodore Forsythe , who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first .	770.8242272685702
 Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again Rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride .	258.12708287056506
 Why , he went on , when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I did n't think twice about it .	273.31983364280063
 I 've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother 's tackle shop .	1041.9317205713949
 Hell , I gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven- how many years ago was it , Rob ?	378.44224205525495
 Seven years ago , Commodore , Rob said impassively .	325.53155527319166
 He was thinking , big deal skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started .	435.03406918185465
 Excuse me , he said abruptly .	203.32904736034882
 He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters ; went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him .	217.78995228584594
 When you got ta go , you got ta go , Mrs Forsythe said .	181.13248321126207
 Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge .	483.7594523143
 He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley .	179.3624617664862
 Hi there , Schaffner , he had said .	30.635228752258083
 Can I make you one ?	600.6003126671969
 No thank you very much , Schaffner had answered in his accented English .	259.46258991988384
 I do not drink so much , thank you .	394.491941654012
 Waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up .	167.533052975823
 He was in his early forties , rather short and very compactly built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways .	253.7275747240449
 His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence .	421.4549644339556
 Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel 's Afrika Corps , and he said to himself I 'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night .	139.57981096175638
 Aloud he had said , making conversation Rob tells me he 's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive .	340.8919973200209
 Yes , Herr Schaffner had said .	372.1034706149105
 He 's one hell of a decent boy .	255.26641685631958
 I like that kid .	381.10540788595034
 I agree , yes .	226.5852194909778
 And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right ?	293.05976320944916
 Well , no , Herr Schaffner said .	284.1908950627871
 Waddell turned to face him .	116.17920265233413
 No ?	529.4939341271964
 he asked .	264.1464700079564
 But that 's what he told me .	222.98160721139425
 Why , that 's his main reason for making the dive .	161.2240442678018
 Shaffner looked at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands .	210.50891376157216
 What do you mean ?	493.2643212824992
 Waddell asked , frowning .	36.00068909966083
 Please let me explain , the German said earnestly , his face still devoid of deceit .	439.8272374542243
 I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year .	611.0257577737167
 Now I wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong .	299.5047504026453
 I must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products .	381.9857027403499
 With all respect to a fine young man , Mr Roy is not able to provide these necessaries .	275.22241394530363
 Waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard .	137.01035499834748
 Did you tell him all this ?	856.4036615076792
 he asked .	246.06785519818612
 Perhaps not in so many words , the German said .	271.86206920213493
 But surely you have misunderstood Mr Roy .	469.5854253304399
 Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights .	458.94160917789526
 We spoke of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity .	267.9507266573716
 He was most eager to make the dive ; of course , I was willing .	110.58966385252505
 But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements .	526.7358815895162
 Well , damn , Waddell said .	201.9044494970639
 There was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline .	65.29074618075661
 He started out the door .	149.1431288009317
 One moment !	820.9738400901804
 Herr Schaffner said .	274.074060043578
 You intend to speak with Mr Roy ?	1039.2819463108149
 What else ?	469.36335135575996
 Waddell asked .	77.2336256197843
 If you will pardon , I think it would be better if not .	158.74989594414365
 Mr Roy is determined to make this dive .	196.28965773142352
 Whatever you tell him he will dive .	206.47233037852976
 I know this from my talks with him .	272.94290828833203
 Well , let 's let him make up his own mind , OK ?	315.4543153871085
 Waddell said .	38.31064580906934
 On the basis of the facts .	48.87342903268272
 You will make him unhappy and anxious , the German said .	362.9489868790189
 At 200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him .	429.46535785725814
 It is not good , Mr Waddell you will do him great harm .	267.5601543753086
 There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said .	397.5244392499931
 Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .	176.51248636170862
 I am an honest man , the German said with fervor .	191.55118855282805
 I will give Mr Roy his due for this dive .	319.7634537593429
 I will make him distributor for all of Florida- a big market .	325.4349955151093
 All tourists come to Florida .	1111.1062882165638
 This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop .	371.99614777385005
 Yes !	2065.4161753244507
 But there is no use causing him to worry at this time .	253.98785612663505
 The German 's words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty .	221.7960664775964
 He took a big swig of his drink .	92.07555848638388
 It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this .	272.191925090716
 I think maybe you 're right , Schaffner , he said .	207.69193974500828
 He has the distributorship for Florida , you say ?	145.3685269184799
 Yes , the German said .	198.49879684500291
 At least for South Florida .	1010.5889399684255
 By God , Waddell said , we do n't want to upset the boy at this time of all times .	187.0812823232625
 I guess you 're right .	730.5819370567441
 He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps .	79.48566803256833
 The story was shaping up nicely in his mind the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America .	407.57358926297366
 Join me in another ?	1112.5720951633289
 he had asked .	162.84081216069234
 Thank you , the German had said courteously .	85.00518180035499
 I do not drink so much .	309.2103852109647
 Now , in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk .	672.3516949061631
 Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions .	272.74522879229636
 He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper .	296.8540132721266
 Blessed Saint Nicholas , I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered .	489.6327408448578
 And when I make the dive again- He paused ; crossed himself ; said a Hail Mary , slowly and with understanding .	754.0306432441973
 Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to Headquarters .	446.31165419135436
 Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive .	429.3113506177124
 Make it come off all right .	849.4380467708525
 Let me set the record this time , and let me get back OK , so the German will give me the exclusive .	393.6860996557318
 And make my life different and better from this time on .	453.6531685981414
 Amen .	4031.415998708452
 He crossed himself again and rose .	303.4552586161485
 He felt a good deal less shaky .	173.79564126774937
 As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk .	245.73537308222814
 Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger .	61.420923645076996
 He waited awhile before he said , Roy , you know your decompression table , do n't you ?	249.70995251859924
 You know I know it , Robinson answered warily .	315.79192775762266
 You came straight up from 275 without a stop , Artie said .	192.92008839141903
 Well , I was a little bit confused .	249.1994535089763
 Anyway , I was n't down long enough to matter .	147.54582256413318
 You do n't see me stretched out on the deck , do you ?	411.42258055877306
 You know what they say about two deep dives in one day , Artie went on , still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently .	183.810961461342
 I do n't think you should go down again .	318.7176205315631
 EARLY that day Matsuo saw a marine .	273.5568657846421
 The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery .	278.0020624678343
 As his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand .	224.2247735847791
 He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed .	330.1613244137644
 In the leafiest part of the tree , straddling a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow .	77.71327619153804
 For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .	455.552782188694
 He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably bred indecision , they would soon come hunting .	310.0920180214478
 His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure .	426.5263267270636
 Yesterday ; today ; tomorrow no surrender .	686.7205119224781
 His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace- only a faint chill of doubt .	558.9654151680569
 He murmured to himself , with firmness No surrender .	305.9196303982016
 It was best to die fighting the marines .	190.04740210794216
 His superiors had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor .	340.6764565405362
 What if the marines never came ?	165.0814511298101
 His comrades were all dead .	556.3805881670878
 He had no rice .	124.61889397252644
 Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .	330.7121912795434
 Whichever the way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes .	196.2043253415331
 He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk .	158.78452973719718
 His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .	1000.2114925454224
 The knife , an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt .	281.0192205516392
 Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth .	477.16549942519487
 As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing .	177.68271363562775
 Gloom receded .	14.04500113193941
 The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though debating whether to brave the sunlight .	311.9287640651702
 His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist .	199.2253116983003
 Come out , come out in the meadow , Matsuo said under his breath .	124.12849114085245
 The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face .	305.8619696486304
 A signal ?	610.447267066916
 Matsuo lifted his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness .	244.75212654424183
 Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills .	357.1445977305584
 They had fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out .	146.95641010500157
 Even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows .	144.3360245748138
 A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing .	177.01573781346744
 The marines let him advance .	193.1115071796138
 When he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy .	221.47811505276695
 Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses , both the burned and the unburned , the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun .	116.02508253472267
 The callous marines had laughed at each other 's retching , while stacking bodies .	194.79373128828317
 Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea .	80.56915069383953
 At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle , reeking of death .	88.49425239441143
 Apprehensively he peered to the left , to the right into the leafy , vine-crisscrossed maze .	57.630953656146794
 He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow , with the one left to distract him .	55.596090779609874
 He strained his hearing .	413.4243721161599
 Cautious feet stepping on leafmold ; faint creaking of belts and slings ; whispers he heard none of these .	321.77864436630307
 Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird .	161.08230829976702
 Because he could n't hear them , he was more convinced they were there .	208.82720392177615
 A spectacle occurred across the meadow the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it .	147.13214315514142
 Humiliation made Matsuo tremble .	200.0147275181554
 While his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver .	284.17616200358026
 Taking aim at the man 's face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind .	239.02633152124386
 He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .	231.920028503854
 The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound .	194.27569030362906
 Hush followed .	115.0786294000957
 Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment , Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle .	341.24683076962043
 How stupid to give his position away .	362.5835069386543
 The jungle did not retort .	30.685690121199805
 The sitter remained seated hugging the tree .	805.4086529435356
 Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy , and insects hummed and birds occasionally called .	263.3501722222212
 Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke .	223.14218580783677
 Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes .	1376.1696830151486
 He went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind chasing of the tail .	187.31094814498633
 It ended when he tumbled ; but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction .	300.6422170255117
 He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon .	402.2190317400641
 With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo 's direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop .	68.27475110981558
 When he got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face .	251.47842266067124
 The pockets of his jacket bulged .	143.18876879379314
 Hand grenades .	5166.491142251379
 the bobbing head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk .	144.40239615490438
 The marine spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward .	201.79752432478995
 In the hush that followed the echoes , Matsuo was tense .	119.39574953878407
 They could come on him now without difficulty .	263.4664660271114
 Gradually he reached a conclusion .	115.54701350077558
 The marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree .	307.43296555227533
 Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage .	475.76673196536507
 The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended .	1512.8006747678526
 Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out .	299.83872106656054
 Reflex ?	49.36572313336699
 Rifle leveled on the man , he made a rush .	140.05812812916497
 Heat , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd .	289.23092103148946
 He squatted by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground .	167.0686142235887
 With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back .	440.6968970057415
 He was bearded .	187.26462067290626
 The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone ; around the hole , blood glistened in a little patch .	192.17559676780775
 Maintaining his clutch on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets .	200.91020021937754
 In one a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man 's bleeding .	191.6306065712364
 In the other a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief .	286.1187760103257
 One by one he tossed the objects aside .	559.7506547363902
 He did n't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter ; he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running .	410.6127843277128
 Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .	407.4499615332126
 Too bad the marine had no water .	891.2282324351014
 From its holder he took his own canteen .	272.5410461333754
 The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure .	276.095120530862
 The marine 's eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened squinted in the glare .	272.1824690912298
 So , alive .	256.87195620522414
 Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .	239.56267889345432
 The marine reached up a hand .	342.56535553505046
 Matsuo shook his head .	178.29872004281825
 None for you .	652.6080702250551
 The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand .	339.50184446170437
 Not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on .	263.3008889920587
 You came well equipped to die .	736.1773650446829
 Some odor made him lean over the man .	711.9415825840609
 He sniffed and recognized it .	55.9743927223261
 Sake .	22.195563334239935
 So that had been his difficulty .	144.24435293788213
 Drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac .	91.06445093951946
 The marine tried to roll on his right side , and moaned .	211.15079891661176
 When he rolled on the left side , propping on his left elbow , Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over .	232.28619439895004
 Be a good turtle .	1082.1412094565235
 Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle .	308.67580550876903
 The smell of sake had freshened yesterday 's events in his thoughts .	319.3108175438521
 In the caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake .	158.2764429797257
 The marine shut his eyes .	680.8891785506642
 Are you a thrower of flame , marine ?	432.6919431395168
 Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine 's reach and away from their shadows .	217.16951227862083
 He waited in his squat , gripping the hair .	65.92442206511797
 Every so often he turned the knife .	555.1451868798845
 Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .	1113.7420010983244
 The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping .	139.79765643386835
 Wet also were the marine 's fatigues and the face had an oily film .	230.04075605587653
 The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes .	239.96033130737388
 Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle .	261.5569624481206
 He must have saturated himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze .	182.06134970401854
 Matsuo shook his head .	177.92128836215625
 Strange .	21.896700631941876
 At last he reached for the knife .	240.71660014522868
 Even the bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine 's handkerchief to wrap it .	205.21695761876035
 First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes .	354.6580091578967
 The marine yelled and flung the hand away .	95.0377213493273
 With a firm grip on the man 's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek .	476.0608548275803
 A shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo 's wrist .	71.02516779751568
 Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat ; burned the other cheek ; burned each hand when they came groping again .	551.7065573660566
 The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment .	419.42027150213164
 Matsuo stood up .	100.47664563939996
 A small measure of payment , marine .	562.7711736810095
 He dropped the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder .	262.36399006943765
 The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach .	296.2758143310852
 He ceased weeping .	1153.2186248763267
 Matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back .	206.38103460849828
 The marine was still .	313.9923061408171
 He would soon die .	249.12127565307944
 As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow .	197.05178471107556
 What now ?	226.4162431975457
 In the jungle , birds were mute , while insects preserved only the monotony of living .	221.68769015741617
 Someone called .	2060.6041078815592
 It was the marine head lifted , he strained and called .	465.0342824115174
 Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat .	339.2210148374547
 He cupped his mouth and yelled .	39.226798859345806
 Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder .	165.92029799190374
 Once and for all he 'd finish this marine who would not die .	732.3918714987464
 He aimed , but listened .	217.64968418607347
 It sounded as if the man were calling him Hey , Japanese h hey there , Japanese .	279.6854452311572
 The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container .	264.95970136630865
 He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .	595.4982622305048
 Sake ?	49.232624732110736
 Matsuo called .	150.5095857621605
 The marine nodded vigorously .	1977.3836666777988
 Matsuo laughed , slung the rifle .	113.00466790151334
 The marine was a winehead .	87.01921668891573
 His superiors had said that all marines were depraved .	57.975324462154184
 The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol .	647.540519809977
 Remembering his own thirst , Matsuo took out his water bottle .	174.45839594163036
 One swallow was all he would have ; he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline .	310.4940398386969
 His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline .	244.6112447781675
 He began to uncap the bottle , the rusty cap squealing on its threads .	145.72310458776005
 Popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted .	394.08723947005126
 Of course it was water he really craved ; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out .	188.85399392633775
 The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack .	497.8056231845741
 Matsuo shook his head .	178.24685291799682
 He had no water for an enemy .	127.09445853808148
 And when this was gone , he had n't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool .	213.45391858289545
 He capped the bottle and replaced it .	116.04512264927823
 After all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine .	310.94519055659407
 Before much longer the marine quieted down .	387.23282896840044
 His head slumped .	83.76806253648758
 The upper part of his packet had stained dark .	228.4920425800034
 Marine .	1182.7497726768263
 There is nothing for you , Matsuo said .	88.76729626671461
 Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion , besides the dishonor of it .	218.60947779183672
 I 've nothing for you .	371.73871142406824
 From the convulsive quivers of the man 's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping .	183.81984333133988
 He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China .	336.7862316945962
 In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , smudged , blood-specked , with the village burning about him and shells exploding .	345.6207703834484
 CHAIRS SCRAPED BACK and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar .	1142.6650747639032
 Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were .	660.4289302267791
 Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame .	278.47805783297866
 He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed .	144.89267570027926
 Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys ?	377.5908228341787
 he asked .	259.52250698371375
 Seems to me I do n't remember altering any law about that .	318.7665640448329
 He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer .	489.3146823575162
 Stay right here where you are , kid , he called .	327.6387961526054
 I do n't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I 'm a-drinking The stranger ignored him .	683.7724733806155
 He did n't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader 's right hand was on the butt of his revolver .	451.6456875572074
 I 'm Billy Tilghman , said the stranger , and I 've come for Pat Conyers ' body .	439.01351707797477
 And what makes you think you 're going to get it , pretty boy ?	576.4827443917966
 Because I 'm asking .	818.1573534340806
 Most of the time I get what I ask for .	329.1756784995684
 Blue Throat winked at his six cronies .	112.22153760964937
 The kid has no manners , boys .	505.57911801259354
 Shall we teach him some ?	2483.2200031431757
 His gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster .	327.1335913512035
 Tilghman 's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin .	247.75972973209147
 His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling .	229.21344645858235
 Tilghman leapt on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him careening against the bar .	139.82765320779274
 A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman 's stomach as Blue Throat 's henchmen started shooting .	629.2799720561743
 Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun .	424.99643155739966
 The Colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing .	215.7495348725951
 A third shot doused the light .	207.00207680527708
 Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , You all right , Billy ?	397.5951202688394
 Yes , George , but I ai n't got poor old Pat 's body yet .	1329.0808150865876
 And I aim to have it .	134.77002985485092
 He fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed .	337.1276472046597
 Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor .	369.49310239835927
 OK , Tilghman , I 'm quitting .	37.06583266190719
 And me , said another Blue Throat henchman .	184.58125811217334
 Somebody brought a light .	1390.0720452102044
 Tilghman and his partner , George Rust , herded the men into a corner .	107.83497740699156
 And now , said Tilghman with deadly calm , I 'll repeat what I said .	326.4768916557053
 I 've come for Pat Conyers ' body .	773.9622653471213
 In two minutes the body of Tilghman 's former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town 's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial .	340.68534849237886
 Blue Throat , nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight .	355.4598972497176
 That critter will be back tomorrow , predicted George Rust , and he 'll bring fifty of his kind back with him .	281.1612191475622
 Blue Throat wo n't stand for this .	773.6112775214167
 He 'll shoot up the town .	244.06867449911954
 The prediction was correct .	341.2199190681141
 The Reverend James Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers ' last rites on Boot Hill in the township of Petrie , when shots were heard in the distance .	251.84345870345533
 Amen , said the Reverend Doran , grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone , and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere .	243.753544943809
 Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle .	330.74534989921796
 Blue Throat , who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months , certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship .	307.446416554037
 It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring , ruthless gun-slinger , and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it .	252.48975351923212
 He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street .	203.2119544199769
 The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn .	291.11073893720965
 Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat 's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire .	1376.1583644021216
 The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster 's Store , halfway down the street .	161.83217607374092
 Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived .	1015.1413736702291
 He sized up the situation and shook his head .	121.58198517854488
 If Blue Throat has his way he 'll keep us all cooped up in here for days , he said .	287.9765316400716
 There 's only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store .	267.3587933403887
 He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom .	201.9193070051582
 Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite .	681.2559021157
 I 'm gon na drop these into Blue Throat 's lap , he announced , and I 'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window .	633.8157603481304
 He slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways .	121.72539776982755
 Blue Throat 's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed .	470.55287422078464
 Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber 's shop and came out at the back .	228.59803100528956
 Here he could n't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang .	272.23143448623296
 All he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through .	254.18210945946686
 Billy Tilghman did just that .	330.1165370140505
 Within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters , with every outlaw either dead or injured inside .	435.8785551858626
 It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat 's dictatorship in Petrie .	157.33142387899193
 Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts .	762.1965682346004
 To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising , smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet .	350.49763112922955
 Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West , Uncle Billy Tilghman stands out head and shoulders .	588.0317934739645
 He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book .	166.49702397198405
 He saw the most action , beat up more badmen with his bare fists , broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other US marshal who lived before or after him .	414.5275966164955
 For fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West .	422.59885039307693
 The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career , his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung .	223.8788108735953
 Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century .	416.71164881989006
 He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890 's .	378.5339231164322
 Led by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns .	406.261649444251
 Bill Doolin 's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him .	250.19489529271925
 Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .	77.72839457050152
 They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses .	276.22104359427556
 Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort .	1101.3923636642544
 On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn 's ranch .	503.21647766314004
 It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .	290.6429437247725
 The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was belching out thick smoke .	383.07760704348823
 The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .	550.4930964977955
 Wait here , Neal , said Tilghman .	114.58803604316405
 If I do n't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse .	705.3362892956519
 Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it .	98.41431547523415
 There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside .	288.3194717391718
 Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day .	1115.1640342175926
 Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed Dunn .	294.7691145510144
 Hello , Ed , said Tilghman .	90.5667495793347
 The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but did n't move .	283.9790825631422
 Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire .	335.0767419038619
 Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck .	262.8983646943807
 Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain .	389.28840017143216
 And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman .	244.55107510885128
 The fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide .	333.11376796726717
 Thinking fast , Tilghman never hesitated for one instant .	423.6865423624547
 He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him .	334.6275106359317
 The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang- every man a killer .	321.0192717064126
 Cold day , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire .	335.9848952251789
 Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives .	502.5988068768525
 Ca n't seem to locate landmarks in this snow .	522.586707240078
 The rancher was trembling .	436.68593170195686
 He would n't look Tilghman in the face .	78.89353041594994
 Follow the river for five miles , he said hoarsely .	263.8161759409532
 Jed 's homestead is on the south bank .	109.43924148310637
 Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes .	582.3360423354679
 All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body .	598.3194639917382
 One false move on his part and he would be a dead man .	231.6844075974448
 Well , he announced , Guess I 'll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the warmup .	157.50250871554252
 He strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him .	100.83535010301372
 He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive .	666.6256000780899
 But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon .	489.6786535276561
 If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .	656.275764658379
 Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown .	239.29342385357634
 Do n't say or do anything , he said softly .	364.4811971696322
 Just get out of here without it looking as though we 're in a hurry .	575.7720395598827
 That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang .	201.2756476366217
 Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman 's life hung on a thread .	708.615840184621
 Back in the house a hoodlum named Red Buck , sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then .	635.7590415968324
 You 'll stay right here , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle .	987.6247450303688
 Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back .	284.270230226861
 We 'll let him go .	375.22912291245586
 But the fighting marshal 's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , Oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets .	439.97696346824307
 Wiley Lynn , a self-styled prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since .	935.9974512327286
 That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy 's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver .	674.9175448138762
 FOR SEVERAL MONTHS now , Jack Carter , a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy , pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a Woman .	126.05624638752035
 This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth ; she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately .	305.09634159324423
 When she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach .	440.92703599943746
 Then he would run to the toilet behind the house .	174.9803928706679
 Sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this Woman was almost always with him .	227.13912919687976
 He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him .	363.4240932360847
 But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right .	276.5461792683471
 And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the Woman of Jack 's mind assumed the teacher 's face and figure .	237.03354579975212
 He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do .	241.7641667674486
 When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh .	175.84074439359912
 Miss Langford her first name was Evelyn was an attractive girl .	384.88635597365874
 Tall , blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress .	292.7277689217729
 Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack .	315.4089282127392
 She would look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick .	240.78309133000178
 School began in August , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another .	253.34669302261705
 The first two or three days they went home early .	685.6680794455592
 All , that is , except Jack .	278.3434515594591
 He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order .	218.0955350538407
 Once this was on the third day of school she kneeled down to pick up some books where they 'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg .	441.16588115807417
 He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating .	444.9435631611972
 About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she did n't even see him .	254.67693217570655
 He jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school .	116.31663097968176
 He did n't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; then he slowed to a walk .	199.22707108112942
 The vision became even stronger now .	567.5679439891724
 I 'll get her yet , he muttered to himself .	335.6938019616676
 I 've got to get her .	398.98240693057363
 That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire .	266.11533691190107
 He ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily .	364.7906395939601
 What 's the matter , honey ?	237.7326197733375
 she said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child .	99.63650697595718
 Are n't you hungry ?	2029.1572021884147
 No , I 'm not hungry , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs .	260.79065385035284
 Outside it was already hot at 730 AM , and it was getting hot in the kitchen .	587.0063161587017
 He felt a little sick at his stomach .	259.71871518382824
 Are you sick ?	2607.775560816548
 No , he said .	76.26350569976236
 I 'll be all right .	236.73437202810823
 I guess it 's this hot weather .	513.5774886729897
 Do n't you play hard today then .	1445.2071948367266
 And if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early .	781.9118098434346
 Daddy left the car for me , and I 'm going to town this afternoon .	300.75279103505994
 O K , I wo n't play hard , he promised .	966.3293638589139
 Just then Charles Lever yelled , Hey , Jack , from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling Good-bye , Mom over his shoulder .	211.3728973048116
 Whaddya say , boy ?	268.36530772454455
 Charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth .	528.6252098458596
 Charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , scraggly , with straight black hair like an Indian 's and sharp brown eyes .	521.4156793639769
 He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .	382.1112912890288
 You know what I done last night ?	929.0035019121117
 Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .	370.3611205653725
 Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were Charles ' only apparent interest .	581.6398972386056
 But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles ' revelations even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention , so he usually invited them , as he did now .	393.3988738063728
 No .	304.78199987302924
 What ?	164.78585730992455
 I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry .	288.60208767421807
 A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack 's mind .	984.3686796016036
 His heart beat faster .	2264.6324289932563
 Hell you say ?	200.9866826531851
 he said , lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles .	207.2737519030597
 How 'd you do it ?	376.64262082895806
 Hell , I jist got on top of- No , I mean how 'd you get her to do it ?	345.5634456516689
 Hell , I jist ask her .	113.10939457312712
 Jist like that ?	151.11968533952574
 Hell , yes .	74.54350445055526
 She 's been hangin ' around me a lot here lately , and I figgered I might as well 's try it .	340.2322276498328
 Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin ' it .	333.23242705623625
 I never heard that .	211.4791282231411
 It 's all over Branchville .	72.73102029884778
 If you 'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself .	599.1218443568886
 I might try it one of these days , Jack said wonderingly , thinking of Miss Langford .	303.74322975567856
 WHEN THEY reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse .	458.49010501163764
 Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .	169.56374828104978
 Time for books , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand .	334.8892096716809
 Let 's go inside .	381.530268047437
 Oh , come on Miss Langford , play with us just onct , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully .	180.58404625833234
 No , not now , said the teacher .	130.96953521173015
 Maybe at dinner time .	764.5099766375919
 Come inside now .	1328.4490153830689
 The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse .	115.17943180044524
 Jack watched Miss Langford all morning .	1369.3787505883158
 He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider .	694.2617565856094
 Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he coud hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did .	384.1124597339624
 At noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball .	475.34883879360564
 Why ai n't you playin ' ball ?	1082.0317650008412
 he asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse .	176.0897735248802
 Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised , several of the little girls called .	394.2504532920551
 I 'd druther stay here and watch the girls , Charles grinned .	618.9195798067555
 Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we 'll see up their dress .	825.9757134756295
 Maybe , Jack said idly , watching for Miss Langford .	333.97995139580854
 Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .	146.390377366224
 When she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , Goody , goody .	128.5376247823905
 Let 's play with 'em , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants .	308.150198492514
 OK Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls .	282.7225318988458
 They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap .	819.1842710988236
 Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head .	328.34449546649864
 While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , Gosh , I 'm sorry , Miss Langford .	399.14458121252744
 I did n't mean to pull so hard .	345.4039242792708
 That 's all right , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes .	191.1669118167663
 It was my fault .	156.54749838808024
 With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack 's extended hand with the other .	811.9228368479818
 When her hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet .	671.7357972469299
 He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .	353.6385533348903
 Thank you , she said , dusting herself off .	134.5255070830752
 Will you play with us again , Miss Langford ?	528.5863230576396
 one of the little girls said .	199.02793250340108
 No more today .	234.3904357969058
 Maybe some other day .	617.2492368387437
 Oh , shucks , the girl said .	82.0483066223964
 I do n't believe I 'll play any more neither .	766.5205736991494
 Me neither , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone .	487.909845735187
 Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun , past Robert Allen 's three-room , tarpapered house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes .	371.4869086907756
 When he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up .	72.68347746513108
 He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class .	307.7403208483153
 That should do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work .	235.92235673662427
 He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he could n't take a chance on either of these possibilities the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school .	364.6593766867516
 The only drawback now to the plan he 'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack .	442.04722650557204
 But I 've got to take a chance on it , he told himself desperately .	330.3872868233579
 To his surprise his plan worked perfectly .	1264.548939830057
 All right , if you ca n't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school it out , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling .	453.85967347829245
 You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems .	1511.46151999918
 And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home .	323.5638669061227
 He scarcely saw them .	275.5785221673237
 His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , How will I do it ?	369.2835345585689
 On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise .	210.966008370779
 She munched little ginger cakes called mulatto 's belly and kept her green , somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck .	551.8094300800223
 The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman .	359.7557726774274
 Lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family .	206.13517513182316
 The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured Look at your watch , Col Garvier .	501.8995316673929
 It is almost time for and calinda to begin .	147.1525831652533
 Col Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans ' most important and enlightened slave owners .	1849.1653016838054
 He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start .	173.4704600696938
 The slaves ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name .	439.8078001463395
 Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum .	829.2316558831521
 He showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently , his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy .	97.06836166097287
 The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds .	242.95625680418388
 The dance was of Haitian origin .	173.6703169254966
 The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows .	255.6539880444246
 He was possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners .	165.93166684206508
 He proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the South 's oldest and most cherished names .	319.9997978089983
 Delphine was a pace-setter in high society .	56.91653783473801
 She was a top horsewoman and one of the city 's most gracious hostesses .	105.43301832346724
 Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil .	220.40864850620173
 Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders .	509.8829087670124
 The slender , handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves .	285.1377292300216
 He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race .	453.7782890664071
 But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his master 's plantation in Bayou St John .	300.741669439205
 Shy , actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls ' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses .	238.0898475764722
 This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near .	642.0856060358028
 The woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection .	325.3871220802427
 What is your name , boy ?	327.22314912171487
 Come a bit closer .	1437.2532962442924
 I wo n't bite , you know .	464.2075886467299
 He gaped at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her .	225.7385025673443
 Then he smiled shyly .	134.38883944226743
 My name is Dandy Brandon , missy .	63.60727529193608
 I belong to Master Alexander Prieur .	500.48417589557147
 She said with intense feeling Come near , let me feel your arms .	1719.8713861885585
 You look quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy .	324.06280434674875
 Mrs Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage .	528.2791267459315
 Lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm .	220.8358487652169
 The woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor .	141.29086546137566
 Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees .	276.90252359784336
 Satisfied at last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver .	260.4598971486938
 This was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows .	37.11953279275168
 Aristide !	65.62906699666253
 I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy 's purchase .	361.59760173501604
 There 's $ 600 in gold in this chamois sack .	106.98632949954832
 If the old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer .	631.2058297743987
 Prieur has gout and depends on Louis ' pills and bleedings .	113.66582820389017
 Besides , he owns 300 slaves .	1146.2935608247585
 One less should n't matter to him .	273.4937083485215
 Aristide Devol , the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native Sierra Leone , smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat .	147.65540282270226
 His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .	348.2336494942557
 Another youth , Madame ?	1538.9002474021393
 the coachman said softly .	255.56120884895904
 This one is a tender chicken , oui ?	280.65314025791054
 Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh .	1696.5102351843134
 It will rip and shred easily for Madame .	178.5199802903344
 Be quiet , Devol !	520.6032037599238
 You are forgetting your place .	187.61818870428635
 The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur .	254.00828108308056
 Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon- cowering in the back seat of the carriage- to her mansion at 677 Perdido Street .	76.08191047620632
 Dr Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion .	168.66062363234664
 Dandy , curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle .	208.70678689887717
 He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head .	169.8700094976652
 Dr Lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket , and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses .	189.89014106189566
 He was about 50 years old .	432.9114286921945
 Another young man , my dear ?	789.5497380386637
 Really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself , he said , frowning with displeasure .	98.71946679974421
 Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster .	90.89552530643465
 Dandy is to be our house guest , Louis .	275.6643120122768
 I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways .	393.94035938412827
 He deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation .	245.37146630547753
 Quite so , my dear .	739.7282712783724
 His room will be ready shortly .	574.0010942102376
 The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave .	266.4719576649925
 Had Dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries ' tender care if he valued his life .	371.8680644974757
 But he liked the smell of Delphine 's perfume .	197.75966979569654
 Besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth .	216.8423761096998
 Also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony .	301.5616901478238
 So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home .	146.31018331826408
 Airless and dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St John .	297.3625975958179
 He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie- after closing the door- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber .	330.84129125886875
 It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell .	206.71953230741426
 When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street , he was carried out in a coroner 's basket .	151.76941571868497
 JUST six weeks after Dandy Brandon 's arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New Orleans ' oldest and wealthiest families were invited .	336.872569431622
 A stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms , and Delphine circulated graciously among her guests , chatting airily of the forthcoming races , the latest fashions from Paris , and Louisiana politics .	217.74951913009014
 Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase .	105.70928341762495
 It was Dandy Brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him .	65.73355785338117
 The lad 's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts .	418.4319422995563
 His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .	164.19470399396073
 Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted Evil woman !	534.2519379759445
 You did this h you like to hurt h to beat people h I want h to go home .	616.1056868730797
 These were the last words he ever uttered .	487.26023717453063
 Convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore .	110.26228677641774
 Dr Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead .	387.17812920318784
 The ball broke up in confusion .	470.7981010980945
 Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures .	588.8379045902805
 Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse .	253.82131587384583
 But at the coroner 's inquest Delphine told a forthright story .	51.99374748587695
 I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him .	440.8261111373854
 It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest .	361.4640864600325
 After I paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night .	302.8716146618795
 How he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , I can not say .	162.3722797437697
 Dr Lalaurie and I did n't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs .	199.46568913917287
 She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion That poor boy !	575.1514309610752
 He must have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced .	357.84818891707226
 Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die .	477.3100071429884
 Such a pitiful end !	172.16586599274274
 Though the slave 's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner 's panel , Dandy 's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded .	153.28393331047639
 The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury did n't feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady .	164.50555107067427
 Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans ' dives .	1331.367432405485
 So the verict was death at the hands of a person or persons unknown , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine 's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold .	155.85470189897188
 Once again life went its serene way- soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners .	1276.8758279114852
 The excitement over Brandon 's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie 's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital .	385.67211683234984
 Then , on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip .	284.13234558955884
 Mrs Victor Dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight .	408.97241283583077
 The manservant Devol and his mistress , Delphine Lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion .	56.281546499833865
 The girl was not more than 16 .	236.62162770139525
 She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back .	460.87673365636397
 The bleeding girl was tiring fast ; the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street .	314.3456501810133
 The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice Help me , somebody !	175.61695016980087
 They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw !	538.4615237711868
 Bastards , he would say , all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me !	165.60105393783184
 Since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent- and even indecent- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero , he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper .	215.65842715136392
 There ai n't nothin ' faster , or lonelier , or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wan na go someplace , Feathertop would say .	194.99072267598967
 The accommodations may not be the poshest , but man !	156.84007248260582
 there ai n't nobody askin ' for your ticket stub , neither .	820.8267656479976
 He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now .	81.1816157753554
 Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child .	83.59959679765001
 Ever since all that .	648.501733056231
 It had been a very long time that had no form and no end .	127.1355123699403
 He was- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own- riding the dark train out .	169.9175452558661
 Out and out and never to return again .	362.28314889762254
 Till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped .	174.70016002259695
 That was the day it ended .	170.37475036040556
 THE FREIGHT CAR WAS COLD , early in the morning .	133.09695763607695
 He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .	132.49070363915277
 He held his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly .	137.35535908721923
 The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn- then with a clash into its slot .	324.35523057583066
 The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .	163.2126598261021
 She pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and Feathertop 's music pffft-ed away .	473.972715601056
 Now that is a very nice , a very nice , he murmured to himself , back in his corner .	213.20411045116728
 A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted .	224.34069746073553
 Hot , that was the word , hot !	282.01937586018573
 Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow 's wings , with the sun shining down over them .	155.26525470960522
 A poet , yet !	266.9145171959272
 His thoughts for the swanlike neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however .	241.48876384501148
 Zingggg-O !	66.71590925199533
 Then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting .	383.7028584718042
 He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .	171.61134562261094
 Curly hair , high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer 's blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes- but then I 'm finished .	227.32170592119866
 We made it , Cappy , the chick said .	36.102569044666154
 Yeah , seems so , do n't it , the boy laughed , hugging her close .	137.8321374239343
 Ah-ah !	66.06897912221376
 Feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants .	48.76101989239816
 None of that .	502.8949116122274
 We run a respectable house here .	505.24615838775713
 They whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall .	283.818678039239
 He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes .	134.40203881476867
 He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .	432.8611967635289
 Come sit , said Feathertop , motioning them toward him .	176.72021469276024
 That crap is softer over here .	79.425470375939
 The girl smiled , and started forward .	368.6540930365191
 The boy yanked her back hard , tugging her off her feet , and gathered her into the crook of his arm .	159.7244128152479
 Now stay with me , Kitty , he snapped irritably .	150.42087917391677
 I vowed to take care of you- and that 's what I 'm gon na do .	158.3317388304101
 We do n't know this guy .	387.4888472331093
 Oooo , square bit , Feathertop screwed his face up .	354.3269308524701
 This guy was strictly from Outsville .	260.24156282053775
 But nowhere !	763.9458382612065
 What is with this vow jazz ?	184.43624413840237
 Feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight 's vibrating wall .	166.62443857969996
 We- we eloped , Cappy said .	32.47101653766555
 His head came up and he said it defiantly .	123.05206692210174
 Well , congratulations .	40.99418781547545
 Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .	301.6914432403044
 These two were going to be easy pickins .	185.0853233875001
 They could n't have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much .	194.96112869160152
 And besides , the chick had a little something the others did n't have .	205.66073139942083
 That was gon na be fun collecting !	496.8590312025898
 But not just yet .	225.67999720237648
 Feathertop was a connoisseur .	13.041126374973226
 He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it .	136.97353640392186
 Come sit , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings .	249.06757834643767
 I 'm just a poor ex-jazz man , name of- uh- Boyd Smith .	201.08202855271563
 He grinned at them wolfishly .	138.0357705782243
 That ai n't your name , Mister , the boy accused .	241.8700918370749
 And you know- you 're right !	405.133988330101
 Feathertop aimed a finger at him .	265.562860135125
 Oh , come on , Cappy , the girl chided .	84.29903358610413
 He 's okay .	17.005802011615113
 He 's a nice guy .	335.19503605895113
 She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her .	935.7459339213426
 Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle .	362.1176718684241
 He cleared his throat ; it had been a long , hot while since he 'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin ' distance .	545.4473892016674
 He had it all doped , of course .	53.87026579492679
 Slug the kid , grab his dough- at least enough to get to Philadelphia- and then have a rockin ' ball with the doll .	174.35473552191942
 Hmm- diddle !	35.27372378991824
 Where 'd you come from , Mr- uh- Mr Smith ?	587.1600054095611
 Kitty inquired politely .	114.48414638016948
 Where from ?	1182.9123984451417
 he mused .	53.32628647472682
 Out .	621.9442436178856
 I been riding train for a ways now .	498.0359104184257
 They lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself .	143.0263401951896
 After a while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , We 'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly , honey .	439.04450456806455
 What 's the matter , she wan na go the bathroom ?	204.4915030435982
 Ernie found it immensely funny .	1354.4211204722176
 The boy scowled at him , and the girl looked shocked .	160.54944647397338
 No !	625.708726545626
 Certainly not , I mean , no that is n't what I said !	317.51149889399613
 she snapped at him .	548.4598684753461
 I only said I was hungry .	338.8409277205702
 We have n't had anything to eat all day .	348.01907528615345
 Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill 's voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .	499.00838168088626
 Why n't ya say so , fellow travelers !	1043.8406083051493
 Why , we got dinner right here .	533.0867199562776
 C'mon , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we 'll have food in a minute or two .	383.87195217095353
 Cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .	54.7840349648863
 Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .	813.3800205862556
 He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it .	539.3102515965976
 He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .	346.7488124515681
 A charcoal pit , man , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier .	135.9524260053289
 Fan it , he told Cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper .	93.70679857580161
 Yeah , but what 're we gon na eat ?	175.58434721680234
 Charcoal ?	50.71915421675224
 Fella , Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man , you try my ever-lovin ' patience .	244.85448822267878
 He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners .	325.0319530194443
 Hot dogs , man .	954.4929961940807
 Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides .	290.6756647893006
 He ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil .	236.92736325636642
 Almost immediately they began to sizzle .	206.39224409376297
 He looked up and grinned .	169.7002630289712
 A Kroger 's self-serve , he explained .	49.896317734742055
 I self served .	819.7335309316115
 WHEN THEY HAD LICKED the last of the wieners ' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette .	169.60787317077944
 Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad .	172.34419779342898
 How come you 're riding the rods , kids like you ?	511.8938880316977
 Ernie asked .	77.05056255086404
 Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply .	166.1382248678407
 But surprisingly , Kitty 's face came up and she said , My father .	251.69396561427203
 He did n't want us to get married .	297.4594690685316
 So we ran away .	305.38125946034563
 Why did n't he want you to get hitched ?	237.6736129809653
 This time even she did not answer .	326.13445485983647
 She looked down at her hands , too .	203.96382439583525
 After a few seconds , she said , Dad did n't like Cappy .	125.34977646479906
 It was my fault .	156.59811349630272
 Cappy 's head came around sharply .	343.70887113419
 Your fault , hell !	2845.1592360988234
 It was all my fault .	176.62545037796104
 If I 'd been careful it never woulda- he stopped abruptly .	699.4133536298021
 Ernie 's eyebrows went up .	64.00397822675274
 What 's the matter ?	158.98887129525605
 The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , I 'm pregnant .	618.8874288294575
 Cappy raged at himself .	47.66824612418885
 Oh he was stupid , her old man !	543.7419389122142
 You never heard nothin ' like it Kitty 's gon na go have an abortion , and Kitty 's gon na go away to a convent , and Kitty 's this and Kitty 's that h like he was nuts or somethin ' , y'know ?	128.40425511284454
 Ernie nodded .	206.74620784916783
 This was a slightly different matter .	270.13743135514795
 He remembered Midge , and the child .	57.67623598025383
 But that had been a time before all this , a time he did n't think about .	193.22321905507513
 A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out .	200.4392548138473
 But these kids were n't like him .	252.8542055118157
 Oh crap !	288.6973783721667
 he thought , Pull out of it , old son .	150.33459074823813
 These are just another couple of characters to roll .	744.675605527921
 What they got , you get .	241.2650419232804
 Now forget all this other .	656.142030261528
 Wan na drink ?	178.91260591387683
 Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket .	214.76262549303308
 Yeah .	22.329240526073356
 Now that you offer .	434.0593980812159
 The answer came from the open door of the boxcar .	72.4616462675604
 From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade .	358.0186611300491
 Ernie stared at the man .	69.64938681206827
 He was big .	91.00717705328408
 Real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly .	302.71739597119364
 Road gang , Ernie thought .	531.9884097842182
 You gon na give me a drink , fella ?	181.65546183396214
 the big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar .	213.84022818312496
 Ernie hesitated a moment .	277.3051997002358
 This character could break him in half .	377.84826792465816
 Sure , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips .	141.45011394382024
 He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder .	44.813739325329976
 The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring .	451.68492358070654
 He took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .	226.07743330411253
 He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously .	116.20605189337557
 He belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .	228.8095176418932
 Well , now , he said , and reached into his pocket .	116.62541464295654
 I did n't know I was gon na have company in this car .	191.73769808954881
 We 're going to Philadelphia , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more .	555.4221065093262
 No , I do n't think so , said the big man , and it was the final clincher for Ernie .	105.37020059837779
 He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it .	213.50419409678435
 Maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ai n't goin ' nowhere .	374.28210111818055
 He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car .	288.7297652598413
 Ernie was screaming inside himself No , damn you , you ai n't gon na take my meal ticket away from me !	1099.0718306521458
 The newcomer stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth .	125.61797803125454
 Her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard .	270.2049836972171
 The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump !	294.8620294493109
 and carried him backward in a footballer 's tackle .	300.6715765519257
 They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs .	316.00422992705273
 The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back .	201.47353681413827
 The fist went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man 's deeper voice go , Aaawww !	352.1335096189422
 Then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade .	173.10527771983152
 He held the knife aloft an instant- an instant enough to press the stud .	410.2660438927604
 The blade came out with a snick !	179.72811906357867
 He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid 's throat .	123.15629031210698
 Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .	232.14678561450347
 She grabbed at Feathertop 's sleeve and shrieked , Help him !	82.55224759248036
 Help him !	84.18317058882096
 Do something !	1319.2724192999544
 They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man .	1851.5118711089826
 To them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after Mass , and at noon , and at six each evening- its tone , repetitive , monotonous , never breaking the boredom of the streets .	345.22206223626307
 The Old Man was unimportant .	659.9640411227969
 Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June ; or the smell of thick tomato paste- the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour- rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth .	355.0701671188501
 Or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights .	265.2930403269368
 Or the bay of female dogs in heat .	823.3498992046501
 They never called him by name , although he had one .	183.0908435661965
 Filippo Rossi , that 's what he was called in the old country ; but here he was just Signore or the Old Man .	154.56640372535912
 But this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders .	450.6228923013952
 Youth obeyed when commanded .	946.8281500074788
 It went to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession .	622.7041163320175
 But youth asked nothing of its parents- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing .	205.20538248378148
 The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened .	578.2966141979398
 But the past was dead here as the present was dead .	170.29458227106133
 Once the Old Man had had a wife .	300.656276090511
 And once she , too , ignored him .	202.38648573452667
 With a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders , she wiggled her satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and did n't stop .	288.5379908242181
 In one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase .	340.3221582919561
 The way she strutted down the street , the Old Man would have been blind not to have noticed both .	376.09489376645354
 Without looking at him , without looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars , rode away in it , and never came back .	536.0975074480173
 But she should n't have come here in the first place , the women had said .	159.58014776941727
 No , no .	256.0527137595207
 Not that one .	127.112726678957
 She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from Torino .	360.71179537288907
 Eh , Torino !	28.918384663799426
 She gave herself fancy airs !	2053.9164972227336
 Just because she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours .	396.195296785504
 They had slapped their thighs .	35.57238978644359
 It 's not for making pretty speeches about Dante those actresses get paid so good .	661.4863311581985
 Henh !	65.4756008621204
 Calloused fingers , caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries , had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted , never to be tweezed away .	141.10076919473724
 Mauve-colored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man 's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again .	253.56278452982104
 Puttana !	65.85853642287367
 But if the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a fig .	817.7174985385334
 It was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed- watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance , as thin as the seams on her stockings , and still thinner .	123.65125661761353
 His voice had not commanded her to stop .	452.66641117582486
 It had not questioned why .	270.76535365231535
 The women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him .	554.5452728503299
 He was never without that dog .	204.53078042244277
 And his eyes- those miniature sundials of variegated yellow- had not altered their expression or direction .	270.08408573568704
 The Old Man 's very soul could have left him and flown down that street , but he would n't have had anyone know it .	273.5393758411061
 Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife .	599.2159100391666
 But when he called for his withered , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar ?	177.6609485845867
 There seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him .	361.48070199454395
 For all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in Italy , not the outskirts of Philadelphia .	168.83613127696046
 It could have been Bari or Chieti for the way it smelled .	124.88836370842272
 What did it matter to him that the park at the foot of Ash Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city 's center at half-hour intervals ?	653.8813632030373
 Or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the Schuylkill ?	955.0338360726762
 This place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness .	192.015087656339
 To him they were one and the same .	110.01852551191018
 Sameness for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city .	365.67448085105633
 Sameness lined the streets with two-story houses the color of ash .	876.5661730086335
 It slashed the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches .	843.6406620325397
 It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors .	38.48234168677275
 Even the stable-garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it .	155.03508815712578
 And the coffee shop on Drexel Street , where the men spent their evenings and Sundays playing cards , had a rose hedge beneath its window .	845.7384851710914
 The hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it .	130.8838751401823
 Only one house on the street had no lawn before it .	299.1221164844765
 It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade .	602.9623317708413
 That was Bartoli 's shop .	89.2864700270221
 Above it , from a second-story showroom , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood .	349.4358934129826
 Did the Old Man remember them there ?	1760.2523356371446
 Yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks- like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery .	164.5971011187433
 Only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences , where one man 's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy .	237.25571292688426
 Love and hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by fig trees and grape vines .	327.22523699755857
 And the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch .	1128.0953611287432
 The Old Man silently fed upon these streets .	2225.240169056072
 They kept him alive , waiting .	438.56703005737273
 Waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not .	354.38764746728305
 It was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price .	128.51943799320006
 He was holding out for something .	150.79304909367332
 He was determined to hold out .	89.14376049138738
 2 The Old Man 's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich .	337.2883223170155
 At fifteen he did n't care that he had no mother , that he could n't remember her face or her touch ; neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him .	534.6566390420488
 He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have cared less about that either .	276.2070117503771
 To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .	609.6439741519334
 When he would be a man , he would be a rich man .	80.00982524731565
 He would not be like the rich Americans who lived in white-columned houses on the other side of the park .	178.69331600911985
 He would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning .	255.94691992256327
 He would not carry a brief case .	213.01727067768843
 Nor would he work at all .	249.62982492526686
 He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step .	604.43372148227
 He would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , bowing with her running , calling out in her bowing , At your service .	351.85459055217746
 He would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff- he would not remove his gloves- and light and smoke .	342.90022495195916
 He could do that when he would be a man .	74.5420088842356
 Hey , Laura !	363.3048966544458
 he called to his sister on the porch above the steps .	349.88347370229116
 She was only ten months older than he .	538.243045167554
 Laura , what would you say if I smoked a pipe ?	452.0123607975647
 Laura did not answer him .	392.4047286069532
 She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , gilded hair in the sun .	598.9705844078621
 One lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking , torn pales .	157.84048721569792
 Her tanned foot , whose arch swept high and white , pointed artfully toward tapering toes- toes like fingers , whose tips glowed white .	850.8447827542578
 All the while she sat there , her sinewy arms swirled before her chest .	407.4449060270911
 Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii .	595.5029338686992
 It was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours .	200.9259731997056
 The eyes , blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality .	184.16260721553226
 Even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance .	176.89249158050868
 He was never sure they fully took him in .	342.7859263911102
 Pompeii called again , Laura !	513.7973341914311
 But the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it .	280.17181830487203
 She 's in a mood , he thought There 's not a month she does n't get herself in a mood .	427.38043287680927
 Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ?	498.5016559827043
 And as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him .	261.445634296947
 Not even Laura .	1490.3183987979355
 Suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat 's claret tongue , feasting against the salt taste of him .	151.00281288762122
 Above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , sallow and time-cast , encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin , stared unfalteringly at him .	274.20159772207364
 Christ sake , goat , git !	215.12227866330855
 But the goat would not .	52.75590958719991
 You 're boiling milk , ai n't you ?	2523.4607317537
 soothing it with his hand , knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch .	41.199656630203386
 Pompeii rolled over .	349.89847106184806
 His head undulated gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats .	271.7235485704105
 With his mouth opened wide , he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light , earthy taste of it .	378.97522257096017
 The boy 's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did .	298.4242883431641
 Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud .	225.36826062884424
 Its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane .	94.19138040247988
 But the boy could see only the goat 's belly .	147.84440239290007
 The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it .	541.1307598670122
 He knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he would n't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog 's back .	329.54469014522937
 There would be time enough , perhaps the Old Man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due .	314.9191766512573
 Time enough to give up his soul .	462.19364576131204
 In the meantime , six sandals , stained an ocher , the same color as Pompeii 's shaved hair , edged up close to him .	164.1453664043765
 The clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks .	134.4643681414223
 He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to Niobe , the neatest ones to Concetta , and the laced ones to Romeo , Concetta 's idiot brother .	74.60161974833957
 Pompeii expected Romeo 's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground .	324.816236742248
 He expected Concetta 's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything .	193.02656574238662
 People came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it .	439.2688462272983
 The room filled with smoke , and Maggie 's head throbbed with excitement and fatigue , but Stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that Maggie could n't bear to do anything to quench it .	347.58223142442074
 Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery .	1462.688836193875
 In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head .	359.9933002175662
 She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her .	810.6962350981373
 She was so heavy that Maggie 's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her .	602.0949577760905
 Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .	260.46137647133116
 Worry had a great deal to do with it ; Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father 's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him .	303.3614645690645
 Mr Clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife 's people without contributing to his and his family 's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap .	601.5933514262798
 Maggie and Stuart pored over figures every night , trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more .	434.35866657450657
 In desperation Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon Do you think you could find me something I could do here at home to make some money , so I could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things ?	486.985767432086
 It seems to me you have enough to do as it is , Eugenia said .	135.82006796981298
 She had been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again .	246.78938171002108
 I have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing something , Maggie said .	373.9609801274807
 It would make me feel a lot better , but the Woman 's Exchange is n't taking baked goods any more and I ca n't leave the baby with Grandma because she is n't strong enough and the baby 's too young to be put in a nursery .	520.5217018891947
 I should think so , Eugenia said .	120.58474891291917
 For one thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day .	796.1351507243425
 She 's so beautiful , and I do like to keep her looking nice .	487.43023079171854
 Maggie said .	38.44767243313769
 She picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck .	811.4857325837401
 She 'll be just as beautiful in something that does n't have to be ironed , Eugenia said .	179.9299116662225
 Evadna Mae Evans said she did n't put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old .	262.11342812186996
 Evadna Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from Best 's Liliputian Bazaar in New York , and I 'm sick and tired of hearing about Evadna Mae Evans .	275.2758946281277
 Well now , Maggie , you do n't have to snap at me , Eugenia said .	96.22492047267738
 I 'm just thinking of a way for you to be sensible .	278.054231390266
 I 'm sorry .	788.0731815600893
 I do seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think of a way to make a little extra money .	234.22275592586502
 Well , let 's see .	305.55762965281065
 Let 's make a list of your assets .	315.68178078930043
 Maggie started laughing , and she laughed so hard she could n't stop , and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining .	560.6543033291334
 When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures .	335.7747399864268
 I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers , Eugenia said .	346.02407427499617
 We could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it 's nice and sunny , but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that .	387.90486742939225
 What else ?	476.506921018994
 You might set up a dress shop in the living room .	411.1027425272925
 Every woman in the block has tried that .	418.88731044341995
 What about a tea room , then ?	276.2001050560919
 You could set up tables in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread and Grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes .	534.8916247095824
 It 's too elaborate .	288.9443927347251
 And Grandma is n't strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am I .	323.584050073626
 Eugenia sighed .	300.50675528215015
 She said , Well , those are the really interesting things , but if you do n't like any of those I can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough .	458.97616560959483
 Oh , I 'm sure I could do that , Maggie said .	187.23488272822402
 But it really would n't be fair , taking your jobs away from you .	484.0152679575744
 Do n't worry , I can get plenty more , Eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could .	482.38747721033883
 Maggie was looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be brushing up on her typing so Eugenia would n't be ashamed of it .	236.6004010796102
 And then whenever I have a minute I can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time .	225.4879780139407
 And I can go back to my contests and be thinking while I 'm doing the washing .	529.5926414987083
 What are you going to do with your feet so you do n't waste anything ?	685.952353365506
 Maggie laughed .	171.01564683522483
 She said , Oh Eugenia , I wish h What ?	343.4164269332918
 I wish I had three wishes , Maggie said .	204.933460945962
 All of them for you .	172.76125173742392
 It grew bitterly cold toward the end of November , contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people .	309.24863666615784
 The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days .	471.1086010756591
 The cold settled like a tangible pall over the Mile High City , locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance ; it had a look of grim stark realism , resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold , instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy Western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources .	445.17084357209916
 The jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies .	759.132828272496
 There were n't facilities to take care of them ; there never had been a need felt for such facilities .	338.9705681745582
 That kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight rates .	295.0566832161482
 The East was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay .	725.5440283204331
 The government offices were being opened but they were n't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything .	1232.9964203134023
 Shivering , people talked and argued ; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate remedies and something had to be done .	523.8991658292715
 Something had to be done ; it was the theme song of millions of American people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government .	413.7206540865197
 Something had to be done .	197.65357152398923
 The Abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day .	231.06570543145108
 Something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half soles , for overshoes , for clothes , for the new leaks in the roof , for gas and light bills ; about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once , twice , fifty times a day .	365.9565943673387
 Just dropping the baby 's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster .	935.5650720810288
 The Abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold .	537.3504570848821
 Cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up , under doors , around loosened window frames , from the sleeping porches , the attic , from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof .	168.4328606435416
 Presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the fireplaces and an electric heater in Grandma 's room .	351.8506436613083
 It was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them , like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive .	292.56492494099587
 The pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms .	440.83955183561255
 They lived mainly in the kitchen ; they moved Maggie 's bed and the baby 's basket there , and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds .	365.29915866434936
 Grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to .	329.0482629499438
 You said a mouthful , Eugenia said grimly .	54.71892713183974
 Eugenia hated being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin .	945.2277129299058
 She said to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever .	179.50815193150643
 Plenty of people are poor all their lives .	308.7268068904405
 Plenty of people have n't our brains and talent .	366.0144124025564
 I know you when you start talking about brains and talent , Maggie said .	456.45222435172184
 You 're working up to something , and if you do n't watch out you 'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the Abernathy family is superior to everything , even a depression .	488.2985521619297
 The only thing that worries me is how I 'm going to prove it , Eugenia said .	304.3033479569296
 They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way .	327.06531814213025
 She did n't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater .	474.3429624891876
 Hope would n't hear of it , and she took the heater back to Grandma 's room , and Grandma took it back to Hope 's room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire .	214.61965426478574
 She said that proved she was n't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it .	294.74385868900947
 Eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma would n't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in .	564.0959723537457
 Thrifty of her to use it up .	105.90312557827586
 Unusual in a case like this , but- You can joke !	290.40488345683644
 Did n't you read it ?	756.0287895780134
 She 's married that tenant !	240.92772611843387
 I read it , yes .	161.67036930266124
 This ought to simplify Tolley 's life .	275.7958714954554
 Laban had more to say .	79.23274282679425
 Tolley had gone to live in California .	186.04592180218697
 He 'd mentioned it , himself , at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that Tolley had left because Jenny had jilted him for Roy robards .	172.1471218515974
 It was plain as the nose on your face that they 're laughing about it , Mamma .	421.68131709715215
 Zion stayed to get my pin , but it 'll be a cold day in June when I go back .	343.579546837036
 We will both go back , Laban !	203.08767574352612
 Kizzie turned to go inside .	189.59397821382592
 Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , Mamma .	849.5667903923127
 The sun 's right- Pictures ?	70.20045060973199
 She swung around .	785.6051451218427
 What pictures ?	852.4358247760765
 In Brace 's room !	148.9233972264507
 You told me to bring my camera .	599.2679417642762
 I 'm not going back- Indeed you are !	656.5467410713168
 Why should I want pictures of an empty room now ?	962.6203080185205
 Tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little Jenny !	76.2814307911622
 This- trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants , and I am going to see that everybody at Mt Pleasant understands that simple fact .	260.1938715780828
 Wait for me , Laban , I 'll be dressed in half a second !	387.6255332762941
 Frank followed her into the bedroom , hooked her dress up the back .	391.44705711535994
 Hurry , Frank !	221.09085477768423
 They 're not going to laugh at the Fairbrothers and Labans very long !	195.90794158299317
 Tolley 's going is my fault .	305.6027773982107
 I drove him away .	201.7900576297908
 You know it and I 'll tell everybody exactly how it happened .	589.4803388775766
 She was so beautiful , so valiant , so pitiable .	83.0050214839674
 He kissed her .	55.847044731817256
 Make your confession to God , Kizzie dear , not to the congregation .	376.2053723056645
 I 'll decide that when I get there .	318.1145570838985
 I was so cruel to Tolley , so unfair .	175.91614980129924
 But I 'll be fair now !	448.70026003050157
 He is coming back , is n't he , Frank ?	188.62837248689397
 Yes , oh yes .	1077.982797436492
 What else was there to say ?	208.43265578205882
 Returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from Jonathan Swift on his lips Under the window in stormy weather I marry this man and woman together .	486.30732550217306
 Let none but Him who rules the thunder Put this man and woman asunder .	1285.474877559402
 Absolution for his lie ?	193.35478855017664
 He questioned God 's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about Kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole , wondering why he had preserved it .	313.43570308966173
 If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it .	460.6734937244871
 In any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons , making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own .	411.36340588348605
 It was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing .	358.60467419899254
 You 've told God , Frank , he said .	335.66244428076044
 Why lacerate the- congregation ?	404.98478493203226
 Reaching for an old clay pot , relic of pioneer days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little pyre to flame , watching it curl , the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash .	411.33476292509846
 Surely now his beloved son could rest in peace .	634.5152010007315
 'And let me go , for the night gathers me , and in the night shall no man gather fruit ' .	348.1814530079771
 A beautiful and haunting line , a subtle genius , Swinburne , difficult not to envy a gifted man , and perhaps he did h. But there were great satisfactions , even for a small man .	194.26758953789923
 Beyond his window were the greening trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal life .	623.9172891461043
 There lay Grand Fair 's Quinzaine , his own young parents ' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , grandsons .	351.15044769798527
 He poured his thimble of wine for the toast he 'd made so often .	348.220869945337
 To absent loved ones .	1781.733642470139
 But this last time he drank not to Brace but To Tolley !	208.1891010139233
 42 MR ROBARDS- Jenny was the only person she knew of in the Mt Pleasant neighborhood who called him that- was kind but too easygoing .	436.6742455443396
 It did n't bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say , Howdy , Miss Jenny , adding a careless Roy , but it did her .	205.07750159035584
 He could put a stop to it , she told him again and again .	179.40155011320593
 Simply call Mr Whipsnade Oscar , and Dr Dunne PG , and C'un Major Frank .	227.21702647078055
 Mr Robards laughed , said he 'd feel a damn fool , plain-out could n't do that even to please her .	443.03179172732166
 You could try .	338.55295737712913
 And if I ever hear you say 'Mist Laban ' again I 'll scream .	490.7370749098615
 And do n't tell me you did n't at church Sunday .	543.0938397082411
 I heard you !	322.70878834789573
 He really had n't meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr Robards .	227.04167196388013
 How strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in- spiritual ways .	431.20173032879376
 Another weakness- far more irritating than his manner of speaking , which he made only token effort to change- was his devotion to that old horse of Tolley 's .	315.86259517022415
 Her horse , rather .	688.8961200244579
 But Mr Robards ' now , oh my yes , indeed , yes !	482.74933754159656
 He called her the Mare much as Mrs Whipsnade spoke of the Queen , God bless her .	380.9508018243621
 h He , with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there in the barn , was reverent only of the Mare , the Racin ' Mare , the revolting Gunny .	89.49691785453476
 For the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny , going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall .	334.7368756497343
 And what had happened ?	237.91144506089566
 Gunny invariably tried to bite her .	657.1728644016367
 Nerves , Mr Robards said , just a nip anyway .	87.30244889425971
 Stand back , Miss Jen , she 's oneasy of your scarf .	68.03946095374884
 Never , Quit that , you sor'l devil !	290.49961910291415
 Never concern for his wife 's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January .	835.1535391286142
 She mus n't annoy Gunny whose foal was due then too !	201.50950934724509
 Listening for hours to his laments that the war and Mist Fair 's poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph , and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come , Jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it .	281.5654001754217
 Gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant- Tolley , the indifference with which the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her disgusting swollen stomach .	341.4705228368499
 Human birth was no novelty to Mr Robards .	521.7830653929241
 Tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick , he suggested .	159.89652353587005
 Jenny 's aversion to having Dr Dunne , a former admirer , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her .	287.9383106336955
 The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure .	399.91019557444554
 He would be in the barn , or riding for the veterinarian !	102.753187955495
 Night after night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter , rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment , fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe , tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house .	224.26580018297653
 Yet when the dear baby came , he had Tillie over here in a jiffy , and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been .	201.00621446061115
 Jenny wished now that she had had Dr Dunne , feeling that somehow he would n't have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets .	325.5317823782009
 There was something not nice about triplets , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they had n't been the son he wanted , saying , You do n't see triplets trippin ' down the pike ever ' day , Miss Jen , hon .	299.18095768848286
 Rhyme 'em up cute- Arcilla , Flotilla h Edmonia for her mother , she said firmly , Jennifer , for herself , and- Kezziah , for Miss Kizzie , he suggested .	149.43204670179915
 She was mighty good to you past times , an ' this 'll fetch her .	606.381294826005
 Now she must be thinking of a boy-name , something special .	229.39968880485256
 Just wait till she saw the Mare 's foal .	238.03930413536875
 Handsomest colt in all Kentucky .	491.1962779425175
 Strong too , up on his legs when he was an hour old .	504.4936364738332
 What about Royal Robards ?	429.05870605333524
 Why do n't you name him Jesus Christ !	1733.9565924987323
 She burst into tears .	1019.3444733799589
 Roy was deeply distressed .	407.6352073923123
 He 'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been .	380.3049399423785
 Of course she was n't herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits did n't seem to rise with it .	493.9140456358712
 He had a good idea why not .	196.61056658504643
 Those elegant At Home cards she sent out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all trimmed up , had n't brought many callers in two whole months .	649.2247703975739
 Doc Dunne and Miss Sis had come .	65.87956216062528
 So had Miss Shawnee Rakestraw , full of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his Heavenly Rest last year , saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town in inclement weather , was looking forward to Quinzaine Spa this summer .	430.98214406108383
 There was an idea .	74.07278252410823
 Miss Kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married , though you 'd have thought a namesake would have brought her round .	434.512554149116
 Oh , she 'd come to see them once , left silver teething rings for all of the trips .	264.99330085749875
 But when Miss Jen went over right away to return the call , Miss Kiz could n't have been very cordial , for she 'd come back before she hardly had time to get there .	450.2781127545392
 More and more , these days , she 'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to Tillie 's and Nick's- his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and pups under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies .	502.360576551406
 Though he was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too .	327.19490677769846
 It made him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea Miss Sis had given him , to be told by Miss Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain Mrs Robards and the children .	303.1092437153744
 She hoped they were well .	373.1571647221799
 He did n't tell Miss Jen , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those Quinzaine nigs , and she really took a fit .	321.07835208187305
 If he ever did such a thing again she 'd die of shame .	740.5338744901328
 Have a party an ' leave 'em out , hon , he suggested .	463.20033053697694
 A swell party , send an invite to ever'body but them- those folks you met at the Galt House , the ones I 've got to know in this new Jockey Club affair , the whole dang neighborhood .	465.1444117415702
 We 'll have oystchers- couple bar'l oystchers 'll fetch in a crowd any time .	234.96759581543438
 I 'll see word gets round .	1527.1417029110194
 Do n't you dare !	1297.9247955439728
 Miss Jen was funny that way , funny that she did n't seem to take to his ideas and perk up .	282.4257537292008
 He was downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try h. Zion was surprised when Roy 's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town .	619.826743120899
 Roy smiled- he did have a nice smile- took off his hat most politely , told her to hop in , and he 'd give her a lift to Quinzaine .	273.4157839527402
 Her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he did n't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on .	650.1706053076355
 See for yourself , Miss Zion .	433.09713187040813
 It wo n't take a minute .	442.03092153802436
 He swung in through his own wide gateway .	207.39606332888516
 Them 's the purtiest babes you ever did see , but Miss Jen gets mighty lonesome .	215.91706239797298
 She 'll relish the sight of a friendly face .	536.8025009807262
 Miss Kiz wo n't care your comin ' , will she ?	687.8958461858937
 Why of course not , Zion said uncomfortably .	139.196652402786
 He must have forgiven me , Henrietta murmured to the room .	490.5252189288535
 The absolution of Doaty 's last will and testament was proof enough of that ; Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman .	205.17400016017507
 She found herself wishing an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin .	514.5069080949947
 Perhaps Doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel .	262.90441520161386
 Henrietta thought , It 's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us .	758.3081758690357
 There had been more to know about Hetty , inevitably , and most of it unfavorable .	118.6907735209873
 Adelia was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted .	193.7986046942023
 Their childhood would have been quite circumspect without Hetty 's flair for drama , especially through the long summers .	436.5592485246071
 In winter , in the city , there had been the Maneret School , which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge ; there had been lessons in French from a small Polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; there had been the dancing class- Miss Craddock , thin and tireless , with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three , one-two-three .	241.00735000471147
 There had been supper parties and teas , fetes and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the Blackwell planets revolved .	304.559584582009
 Mama had died before the corruption of the family circle , the interruption of Charles .	389.1981940736007
 It was safe to assume that Papa , sighing heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , Thank God your poor mother was spared this , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in Charles ' hand , just because her poor mother was gone already and would never know .	453.38302459648185
 Mama was vulnerable ; one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her .	500.79550412820447
 But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta .	523.7417568800322
 She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .	306.6111249447176
 Only at this moment- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty 's bed- she found herself examining how others might regard her .	642.157772040798
 Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice .	614.5338055397955
 She turned on her side , finding the idea oppressive .	245.85540073953902
 If Adelia had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run away with him ?	510.7097062240211
 Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone .	318.01688419157045
 No temptation , no sin .	429.2448316359074
 No temptation , no virtue ?	786.79600957026
 A curious thought to end a curious night .	553.8353852334859
 The birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all of Doaty 's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf .	392.6200455172979
 Before anything else , she would go to Doaty 's grave with flowers from Doaty 's forgotten garden .	462.1016427576408
 Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards .	707.5734071098092
 She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls .	1403.791384374695
 It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray .	210.3111930327211
 After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .	518.0866780017545
 The garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness .	149.48388003630225
 Leaning out , she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it .	151.36030359825222
 On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song .	357.3068558579044
 It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age .	308.8941131598274
 Feeling suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs .	390.63605972818266
 Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human .	119.6034653243383
 Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .	334.32091924838926
 Outside , the garden , the tame wilderness , yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies , sweet william , scented stock and lady 's bedstraw , which she tied with long grasses and took back to show Rosa , who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing Folly .	151.25052141985717
 The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws .	65.00779358375743
 Henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for Doaty .	255.9295584465355
 Rummaging in the dew , said Rosa coldly .	22.455637514010622
 Go change your shoes before you turn around .	2254.2349627088315
 She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home .	940.5766116416099
 Folly danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door .	693.493339837937
 To a Blackwell , there was only one church .	90.81091679292496
 The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea .	181.13933862134675
 For the first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity .	433.47634647835514
 She smiled and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child .	510.9346115596201
 Now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested .	132.8823215504149
 An old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than reflective look as she passed , the sap still plainly rising in his branches .	378.2035218425971
 On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning .	487.4859812964602
 He cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition , announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time .	215.17936580582438
 He then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was unenthusiastic .	117.38392091514083
 Summer 's been slow to come , he said .	121.37093595217952
 It 's my dryin ' out time .	171.77512444057638
 He scowled at her flowers .	99.9967833830315
 I 'm taking them to the cemetery , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality .	362.26301680475274
 They 'll be takin ' me next , he said pleasantly , but not so soon 's they plan .	368.8125895139969
 See half of 'em in their graves before I choose my own coffin .	320.93802774314827
 It 's dryin ' myself out that does it .	144.4320694327331
 He regarded her with rising hope .	563.5071265933205
 You 'd like to hear how I go about it .	415.4997160294668
 It 's nice of you , Henrietta said doubtfully .	248.54638494248488
 Y 're welcome .	4439.357337942309
 He straightened himself , soldierly against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots .	379.3647542091881
 His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text .	254.57984434206588
 Every month , f'r three days , he said happily , I take no water into my system , no water whatsoever .	265.449513142609
 It rests the tissues .	478.4867252628388
 Henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense .	754.2283607371675
 Rests the tissues , he said , and pacifies the system .	60.428999606891416
 My dad did it , and he lived to a great age .	93.51720605889827
 He looked up at her sharply .	185.5908481819292
 Do n't remember , do you ?	433.7797740533663
 She did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old Titus , who must have been in his nineties when Henrietta ran away .	224.3924817833856
 Next to the Blackwells , Titus had owned the island most , and she and Adelia had often stood in front of him , silenced by his terrible years- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner , more aged than possible .	234.30769985758883
 He had never spoken once to the awed sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea .	240.0548291611053
 It must be that son who sat before her now , shriveled to half his size and half his senses .	322.8636032683009
 She said gently , Of course I remember you .	1141.4498856852247
 Not so well 's I remember you , he said .	271.7708874670189
 Y 're the young Blackwell woman .	507.90385474961727
 Ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man .	92.88311365024917
 I know all about you .	182.88187624046847
 You do seem to , said Henrietta , impressed .	579.2969465831965
 Ca n't blame a man for leavin ' his wife , he said quite cheerfully .	168.21205773139638
 Left mine many a time , only she never knew it .	466.4196038796307
 Man in a boat , there 's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit .	285.3618733083666
 Any harm in that ?	1087.9011016850911
 Probably , said Henrietta dryly .	361.29774432016575
 He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly .	280.0004660562896
 You 'd be the one to say , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were different , since all actions had their own laws .	553.0548774842177
 Only , this old man 's connivance was even less to her taste than Selma Cotter 's open censure .	183.7810643710644
 Well , she had not come back to Great Island to be understood , praised or condemned .	365.4097666349135
 She had come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow .	211.14102688978832
 She started to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a big-boned , drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress .	247.882773955052
 She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man .	614.7765676807968
 You 've not had your breakfast yet , gran'dad .	378.6322778322477
 Y'r dam ' porridge is no breakfast , he said .	220.34168293532804
 Milk and sops !	336.88812878708467
 He beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones .	121.23473055348975
 He 's owly today , his grand-daughter said wearily , and bent to pick it up .	95.84572180725354
 He 's got this idea about drying out h It ai n't an idea !	1167.407163021988
 If it ai n't an idea , she said , how comes it you can drink beer but not water ?	676.8027738570953
 He looked piously to heaven and said , Beer do n't affect the tissues none , and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence .	350.6912246752627
 His grand-daughter sighed .	178.56816367979107
 Come on , do .	547.377779226062
 The children are eating , and Miss Blackwell 's on her way somewheres .	203.7597551166377
 To the graveyard .	128.91202747437262
 Who ai n't ?	3617.255362885248
 Not me .	231.31078038228884
 I 've got a day 's work to do.- You 'll be visiting Miss Doaty , ma'am ?	340.0538095673831
 Henrietta nodded .	5496.22978768201
 How much they knew about her !	465.68182847018653
 The woman she must have been a tiny baby when Hetty and Delia had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small answered the nod with her own .	804.7721822759761
 God rest her soul , she was a sweet one .	640.5443830548804
 Come on now .	653.3413278664731
 She put a strong hand under the old man 's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old .	439.683467037495
 He mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength .	367.8108835652244
 There was a gabble of voices from indoors , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of swearing from the old man .	328.528409293733
 Henrietta looked down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on their journey 's way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , Folly dancing ahead of her .	392.3697725721754
 At the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , dotted with fat round bushes like sheep .	572.6996266367026
 They were covered with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots clawing at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry .	298.22435350509744
 The air was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky .	252.63713822978417
 She felt mindless , walking , and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty .	474.29592259964585
 Both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them how many things had lessened while she was gone away but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named Dorothy Tredding seemed suddenly impossible .	777.3407269152417
 She sat down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with sea-damp , her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss .	515.2175405002189
 The day 's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her parasol , if only to shade Doaty 's flowers .	413.9582974974472
 A small , rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery .	452.1339023979222
 She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts .	356.5976130874237
 The Momoyama family had come from Miyagi Prefecture , in the northeast of the main Japanese island of Honshu , where there are still traces of the mysterious Ainu strain .	183.4735205949886
 The Ainus were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal ancestors of the Japanese came from Southern Asia .	245.8873114436596
 Apparently they were of Caucasian blood .	218.8810099577691
 They had white skins and blue eyes ; all their men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful .	549.4118796514995
 A pitiful few of them are left now , to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants , which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the American Indians .	173.14339972606658
 Most of them have been assimilated , but sometimes a man in Miyagi or Akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average Japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the South .	178.69962825325544
 Tommy Momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions .	514.9709597765434
 She was taller than most Japanese girls , and had the exquisitely willowy form of the Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall .	232.38400519801846
 Her nose was higher of bridge , her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn , and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong .	429.7295229635167
 Her mouth , soft and full , was something for any man to dream about .	511.21088229680305
 She had black eyes , long and intriguingly tilted , and the way she walked was melody .	367.0854718637836
 She had been in Japan just one week .	437.02495762009124
 It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at San Diego , Bremerton , the Great Lakes , Pensacola- any place the Navy had a hospital- with a threat to resign her commission if the	368.8949788270431
388.39031217165075
