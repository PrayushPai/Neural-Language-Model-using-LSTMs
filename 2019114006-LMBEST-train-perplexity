 The jury further said in <unk> <unk> that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted .	220.8002126711519
 The <unk> term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge <unk> <unk> to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the <unk> primary which was won by <unk> Ivan Allen Jr. Only a relative handful of such reports was received , the jury said , considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city .	466.77659053319275

 The jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might <unk> this program in our less populous counties .	618.1808146611025

 Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous <unk> , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and <unk> .	323.2060118744593
 Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week .	550.6594181146544

 Daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help <unk> an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug 31 .	1122.0515986341015
 He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the <unk> law which has been on the books since Texas was a republic .	296.2058356775671
 It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more .	657.846954600052

 His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , <unk> B Jones of Houston , J B <unk> of <unk> and Howard Cox of Austin .	506.8114316349157

 AUSTIN , TEXAS - Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas ' big cities Thursday .	1724.4338906775758

 When the shouting ended , the bill passed , <unk> to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen George Parkhouse of Dallas .	352.24857229969626
 Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen Parkhouse .	673.1518718699649
 The bill would increase from <unk> to <unk> the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project .	218.15213569244196
 Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas .	2708.9976855339833
 <unk> by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten 's attack .	773.3654981101655
 The bill 's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J W <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> de la <unk> of Mission , Sam F Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of <unk> Springs .	628.4771783357374

 MUST <unk> PROBLEM The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is <unk> million dollars , said C <unk> Martin , president of <unk> <unk> Scott Co , committee chairman .	763.3316483754114
 We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence , Martin said .	579.3553938235418
 The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems <unk> limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color .	493.41682009770597
 These , he said , are two of the principal underlying causes for family <unk> leading to ADC .	310.0513837987716
 <unk> FOR <unk> Other recommendations made by the committee are <unk> of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity .	377.141455157938
 Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of <unk> and illegitimacy .	320.10852894936215
 Several defendants in the <unk> police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday .	1307.7721387112726
 The <unk> by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , <unk> observers and was viewed as the <unk> to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial .	594.1448808519781
 Bellows made the <unk> when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan <unk> , 30 , a separate trial .	376.04779052939534
 Bellows made the request while the <unk> jury was out of the <unk> .	110.14142288983092
 <unk> <unk> <unk> The statements may be highly <unk> to my client , Bellows told the court .	151.7916777608474
 Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property .	730.2520248006097
 It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others .	304.7937657035438
 Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this ?	1545.2065202794192
 Yes , your honor , replied Bellows .	755.7223425555223
 What this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a <unk> fight in this case .	119.4816911744661
 There is a conflict among the defendants .	128.1280493879169
 WASHINGTON , <unk> 24 - President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio .	1198.5964117653161
 The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first <unk> of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone .	482.20255420620447
 Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in <unk> from <unk> Port , Mass , a White House spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion .	512.9398177182883
 <unk> ARE <unk> Asked to elaborate , Pierre Salinger , White House press secretary , replied , I would say it 's got to go thru several more <unk> .	538.8573827396547
 Salinger said the work President Kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia 's demands and proposals for the city .	673.4621773529365
 The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M Karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means .	1177.252982305882
 Karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the 50 persons .	354.8402933040279
 He said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens .	224.8963889173649
 Karns ' ruling <unk> to eight of the 10 cases .	446.8317153977463
 In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case .	88.54564490120458
 <unk> proceedings originally had been brought against <unk> persons in 133 precincts by Morris J Wexler , special <unk> .	1000.7945648928371
 ISSUE <unk> <unk> Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury <unk> to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury .	650.6920718286118
 Mayer Goldberg , attorney for election judges in the <unk> precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation .	1391.7426418900063
 Wexler has denied repeatedly that <unk> was used in questioning .	489.0878285772801
 Karns said it was a <unk> act for Wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room .	482.3267773659177
 He said this constituted a very serious misuse of the Criminal court processes .	490.2271401730592
 Actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county , <unk> <unk> of the authority of that court is not the function of this court , said Karns , who is a City judge in East St Louis sitting in Cook County court .	309.52583733293153
 <unk> <unk> <unk> Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons .	579.3617048885739
 Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary <unk> of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another .	391.48851298341634
 The cases involved judges in the <unk> , 24th , and <unk> precincts of the <unk> ward , the <unk> and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward .	289.49932384186246
 The case of the judges in the <unk> precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under <unk> by Karns .	225.4805862943883
 Two other cases also were under <unk> .	213.3938928147533
 <unk> <unk> <unk> After reading his statement <unk> the 23d ward case , Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been <unk> , he would dismiss them .	536.5212634421636
 WASHINGTON , FEB 9 - President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of <unk> million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs .	1539.9400111750888
 The President , in a special message to Congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research .	1249.8271352157394
 The aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol hill .	893.4764584766483
 It was defeated in Congress last year .	303.0838780116221
 COST UP TO 37 A YEAR It would be financed by <unk> the social security payroll tax by as much as 37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes .	1095.1703379311657
 The social security payroll tax is now 6 per <unk> 3 per cent on each worker and <unk> on the first <unk> of pay per year .	307.9438521873873
 The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to 5,000 a year and the payroll tax to <unk> per <unk> <unk> per cent each .	387.47550381924293
 Similar payroll tax <unk> would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system .	539.8163930288429
 The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs .	535.8708062818355
 <unk> WOULD <unk> Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 .	808.1511390475579
 Both figures would go higher in later years .	429.8468106126291
 Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would <unk> federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years .	764.1305561210729
 These would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes .	246.93873592703628
 <unk> HOME <unk> The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 1 .	1274.6167537889385
 Full payment of hospital bills for <unk> up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay 10 a day of the cost for the first nine days .	340.31848892173014
 2 .	90.4083636613082
 Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital .	2158.9019774410785
 A patient could receive up to 300 days <unk> nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the <unk> credit .	619.5952674535158
 3 .	146.27408476619252
 Hospital <unk> <unk> diagnostic service for all costs in excess of 20 a patient .	551.6066445378615
 4 .	136.54928877458389
 Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness .	3044.6554802261644
 The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged .	1194.7976251931707
 <unk> <unk> <unk> He said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers ' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their <unk> or those of their <unk> caused by an extended hospital stay .	256.2259473940546
 This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs , he said , and with sufficient <unk> ' requirements to discourage any <unk> or unnecessary <unk> of our hospitals .	330.48245819813206
 This is not a program of <unk> medicine .	64.53597326958526
 It is a program of <unk> of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed .	274.31040709590184
 Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital .	467.47415158505345
 WOULD N'T <unk> <unk> The plan does not cover doctor bills .	900.6969661080016
 They would still be paid by the patient .	73.77702820418934
 Apart from the aged care plan the President 's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools .	966.0654129008343
 The President said the nation 's <unk> medical and 47 dental schools can not now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care .	536.3234265674851
 Moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and <unk> because they ca n't afford the schooling costs .	266.9271455369756
 <unk> TO <unk> The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to 1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students .	563.6066193348616
 The schools could use the money to pay <unk> scholarships , based on need , of up to 2,000 a year per student .	340.04033369954817
 In addition , the government would pay a 1,000 cost of education grant to the schools for each 1,500 in scholarship grants .	360.90612503428633
 Officials estimated the combined programs would cost <unk> million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 .	757.2675747227348
 The President recommended federal matching grants totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or <unk> the capacity of existing ones .	1347.4325558009994
 MORE FOR <unk> <unk> In the area of community health services , the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction .	696.6120023122846
 He asked for another 10 million dollar initial appropriation for <unk> grants to states to improve nursing homes .	1118.47175117484
 He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals .	1297.0806873348738
 In the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children 's bureau .	399.71500344679214
 He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute .	887.0599982920622
 <unk> RESEARCH FUNDS The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation .	879.3732973759817
 He did not say by how much .	79.73977959276604
 For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities .	930.3842272220002
 The President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the <unk> million dollars in the <unk> budget for direct government research in medicine .	358.82220130040145
 The President said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them .	343.02092778603946
 REACTION AS EXPECTED Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines .	2833.927991656514
 <unk> who last year opposed placing <unk> under the social security system criticized the President 's plan .	616.321367240255
 Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message .	1749.5524525595076
 Senate Republican Leader <unk> Ill and House Republican Leader Charles <unk> <unk> said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance .	1295.4316173573757
 <unk> said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first .	803.218580980226
 House Speaker Sam Rayburn D , Tex called the Kennedy program a mighty fine thing , but made no prediction on its fate in the House .	907.9065084608679
 WASHINGTON , FEB 9 - Acting hastily under White House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C Weaver as the nation 's federal housing chief .	2504.9001445672798
 Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote .	331.3944921347854
 A number of scattered <unk> and <unk> was heard .	62.94812910957442
 <unk> Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency .	728.8228300404809
 In the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor .	632.6669771903945
 <unk> BY DEMAND The rule was enforced by demand of Sen Wayne Morse D , <unk> in connection with President Eisenhower 's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy 's in 1961 .	1151.9592615436634
 <unk> The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign <unk> has been the freer , <unk> , and wider discussions , <unk> by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings .	624.984626957515
 This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes .	438.13408833064
 In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of <unk> , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems .	245.02157913685494
 This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the <unk> powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems .	303.90457630312153
 The <unk> of a <unk> between those in trouble in Africa , <unk> by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally <unk> of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been <unk> by its absence .	210.94950618008767
 <unk> <unk> In the case of <unk> , which a few weeks ago was <unk> ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its <unk> policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension .	278.07816271023916
 The general , remarkably <unk> , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council .	291.5447975042984
 There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad <unk> NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as <unk> will be discussed in advance .	480.78512367681566
 Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO <unk> .	353.1179491519074
 Even <unk> , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this <unk> capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line .	332.7873224860003
 On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for .	318.3925854347886
 One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk 's speeches as <unk> .	948.7893665799406
 But he hastened to add that , if United States policies were not always clear , despite Mr Rusk 's analysis of the various global danger points and <unk> for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy .	401.6131481801007
 <unk> <unk> A certain <unk> may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a <unk> affair , with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents <unk> .	307.5263362830178
 The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr Rusk 's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and <unk> frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to <unk> firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .	572.6074044628123
 The Secretary of State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months .	228.2101346984129
 But where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only <unk> the United States ' profound attachment to the alliance , <unk> of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO 's disposal in European waters .	321.1681466719919
 The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another <unk> in Berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole .	284.7444768025516
 <unk> <unk> The secretary 's greatest achievement is perhaps the <unk> of NATO realization that East-West friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection .	521.5351757359349
 The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic <unk> and Development when <unk> as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent .	372.73021625559977
 This increase in the threshold , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance 's most difficult problems in the months to come .	248.51653528875647
 Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled .	855.3711413120434
 WASHINGTON The Kennedy administration moves <unk> toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy <unk> for the first time .	761.2887070956074
 There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos .	298.80481964465673
 The United States , State Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam .	1244.5196752076272
 They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this .	394.7254317011713
 The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated .	870.6774456708537
 But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility .	232.76370394957613
 POLICIES <unk> The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos , rather than continue to insist on a <unk> of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference .	530.6444894451389
 This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make .	306.53738053135214
 It <unk> these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration .	383.4870903543641
 Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas .	549.1688438061269
 But with the months moving on- and the immediate <unk> with the Communists showing no gain for the free world- the question arises How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ?	1411.3964677449121
 <unk> <unk> Richard M Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union .	635.3951541892524
 He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy 's tendency to be too <unk> .	244.8643613035635
 GOP <unk> It does not take a <unk> poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this <unk> the situation as Republicans see it .	378.3590274836529
 They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made <unk> and monumental <unk> in Cuba .	206.88702955349964
 One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he did n't attack the Kennedy administration on this score .	543.7092187713181
 His reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now .	98.79499352511993
 But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first .	362.6500910799801
 The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator <unk> B Morton R of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican National Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination .	773.4145109775578
 Kennedy administration policies also have been <unk> now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston University , <unk> , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators .	698.8752490782668
 <unk> <unk> This group <unk> with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by <unk> groups .	147.41907972153928
 It <unk> that the United States seek instead to <unk> the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic <unk> and a resumption of trade relations ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds .	588.2213642643218
 Mr Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation .	614.9285719995814
 But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated .	676.0917034749897
 Until the Cuban <unk> and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had <unk> a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr Nixon and the professors .	405.20500578558864
 AID <unk> <unk> Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the <unk> period of the administration .	529.1285883040134
 <unk> efforts were made to remove pin <unk> from administration statements .	521.0506184941006
 <unk> on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed .	1445.371495102141
 But thus far there has been no response in kind .	258.84006363868787
 Foreign aid programs were <unk> to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations .	1011.1549652785957
 In Laos , the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture .	971.004745856132
 Again and again it asked the Communists to freeze the military situation in Laos .	370.7687715633847
 But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate .	927.9430458689521
 And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization .	1941.3386222384454
 SEATO was steamed up and prepared <unk> plans for coping with the military losses in Laos .	503.28144026261924
 But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos .	511.6984550017938
 Some SEATO nations <unk> , however .	407.8268063015885
 There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet Nam .	746.9049212220656
 The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos .	581.558958643561
 The pro-Western government , which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma neutralist government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army .	736.4473496366363
 There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the <unk> .	239.06013390300228
 If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma , whom it felt was too <unk> of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish them .	490.81396412233937
 One factor was the statement of Senator J W <unk> D of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .	476.2891203243311
 He declared on March 25 that the United States had <unk> a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of Prince Souvanna .	322.5051566804343
 WASHINGTON The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile <unk> in the United States .	380.6803375578357
 The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation .	174.93218300899872
 In an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President 's committee on <unk> <unk> and <unk> , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems .	384.10750920180845
 The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in <unk> this disturbing crime trend .	596.2093658444484
 <unk> <unk> The President has also called upon the Attorney General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem .	210.07877726522887
 Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L <unk> , a special assistant <unk> the Attorney General , as executive director of the new Committee on <unk> <unk> and Youth <unk> .	327.57365059226794
 His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases <unk> juvenile <unk> have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in <unk> .	453.34590424495264
 Among <unk> reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and <unk> involved persons under 18 years of age .	473.6414968136965
 East Providence should organize its civil defense <unk> and begin by <unk> a full-time director , Raymond H Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes .	1052.2422626419595
 Mr Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time .	499.54227868840354
 East Providence now has no civil defense program .	1181.07274374394
 Mr Hawksley , the state 's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years .	270.33870440019285
 He is not interested in being named a full-time director .	268.1908845149759
 Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation 's civil defense program , Mr Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director .	661.7440098570243
 He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about 3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to <unk> the salary costs .	460.26921085937323
 Mr Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job .	458.09227257752235
 One of these men is former Fire Chief John A <unk> , he said .	341.9878738468457
 Along with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized .	473.35761766113177
 Mr Hawksley said .	563.8225494755295
 One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program .	411.31124641906763
 <unk> funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , <unk> and rescue trucks , he said .	296.30778594914324
 Mr Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station .	1720.1597460818668
 He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the <unk> section of the city and the other to the <unk> area .	76.05492013655403
 Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack .	215.8226324050883
 The Narragansett <unk> <unk> grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a <unk> theater in <unk> would be another .	125.50149568186404
 <unk> residents would go to the <unk> assembly point .	151.6725815523478
 Mr Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack .	744.1051898858792
 Such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know .	299.44447533443184
 If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally .	647.8000774043022
 One of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid .	124.29250331477847
 Other steps would be developed after information <unk> down to the local level from the federal government .	176.05951843887357
 Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind .	748.7437238016971
 Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly .	353.3873557619828
 The governor 's move into the so-called blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R Grant , deputy city clerk of Central Falls .	908.1438043399145
 A copy was released to the press .	148.8419004382863
 Mr Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant .	853.1887605188701
 The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature .	285.480878867766
 While the city council suggested that the <unk> Council might perform the review , Mr Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty Gen J Joseph Nugent to get the benefit of his views .	446.81866591956947
 He will then appoint the study committee with Mr Nugent 's cooperation , the governor said .	457.2374780850333
 I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings , Mr Notte said , to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and <unk> groups affected by these laws .	280.356367664393
 The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales .	607.5008745449679
 The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws .	701.4962734262658
 Should there be evidence they are <unk> , he has said , the state police will step into the situation .	186.63723029392338
 There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws .	458.73821782754993
 The statutes , similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the <unk> .	369.33304781604323
 The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday .	1672.6252486110618
 The only day they have a chance to compete with large <unk> is on Sunday , the council 's resolution said .	236.6420084097396
 The small shops must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community , according to the resolution , which added that they also are the source of <unk> for thousands of our neighbors .	148.29707279705767
 It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government .	1059.286822359226
 The council advised the governor that large <unk> , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business on Sunday .	629.379667331674
 They operate on a volume basis , it was contended , and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community .	243.54261636910715
 Liberals and <unk> in both <unk> Democratic and <unk> should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George H Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday .	982.6951888078637
 Mr Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the <unk> Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system .	427.37403793922977
 He suggested that a <unk> of forces might allow the average <unk> a better pull at the right lever for him on election day .	245.8956927054646
 He said he was <unk> that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 .	70.62180079580308
 That , he added , was when he was a very young man , a machinist and <unk> by trade .	92.36227455816007
 That was before I studied law .	240.11278433941365
 Some of my fellow workers were <unk> me for an office in the Socialist Party .	278.59876396085474
 The lawyer with whom I studied law <unk> me off the Socialist track .	384.5946133970112
 He <unk> me to the right <unk> the free enterprise track .	136.69170074194648
 He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the <unk> of all resources .	156.98013772489298
 He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties .	509.8555871858434
 Mr Reama , who retired as vice president of the American <unk> Co in 1955 said , Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national <unk> but neither told us how to achieve it .	523.5017075312592
 He said he favors wage increases for <unk> but manufacturers are caught in a profit <unk> and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added .	386.5920033903841
 <unk> the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr Reama said A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own .	507.3950919699407
 Mr Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling .	967.1905243558319
 A petition bearing the signatures of more than <unk> Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town .	626.2269024590476
 William A Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond <unk> <unk> .	527.9416162029122
 The law which <unk> home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of <unk> for <unk> of the signatures within 10 days and Mr Martinelli happens to hold that post .	378.51233841204754
 Mr Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the <unk> of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days .	643.7461769248605
 He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of <unk> completes its work .	337.89060065702824
 A difference of opinion arose between Mr Martinelli and John P <unk> , town <unk> , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled .	310.36998177640476
 Mr Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while Mr <unk> said that a special election might be called instead .	289.78670471503676
 Mr <unk> said that he had consulted several Superior Court <unk> in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures .	490.79782527374783
 He assured Mr Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible .	322.53696812130323
 Mr Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement .	1440.445101897739
 He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes .	268.18521849394165
 After inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow through on it , he declared .	340.47549405505725
 It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will <unk> the movement .	216.0670442595166
 He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required <unk> ballot for posts on the charter commission .	241.433159477191
 Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement , he indicated , and to tell them what this will mean for the town .	162.7876788522769
 He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September .	319.9364028934797
 Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town 's <unk> Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter .	906.5245288491227
 <unk> opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated .	171.7113427723336
 <unk> of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed false <unk> .	553.8206211073924
 Several <unk> affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston <unk> District sewer system .	371.3769888666422
 Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay <unk> at the local police station may be taken at Monday 's special North Providence Town Council meeting .	1875.397910950884
 Council president Frank <unk> said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town <unk> Michael A <unk> to draft the ordinance .	1690.8813472179838
 At the last session of the General Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective .	331.0244053171209
 Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation .	255.07726394374845
 At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition .	1225.653815907941
 Local police have hesitated to <unk> them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense .	496.8604334941018
 <unk> - James P Mitchell and Sen Walter H Jones <unk> , last night <unk> on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is <unk> on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism .	671.1089831669417
 Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen Wayne <unk> Jr <unk> did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel .	971.7645885113411
 The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club .	2568.931372433317
 It was greeted with a chorus of <unk> by 500 women in <unk> Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women 's Clubs .	301.7876429151354
 Hughes said Monday , It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the <unk> <unk> after Eisenhower retired .	460.6952702861676
 Now he 's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the <unk> remains to the people of the state .	78.27325099584097
 Sunday he had added , We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president h but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership .	343.5089574555265
 Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign .	260.7567633171971
 How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this ?	588.8336274025103
 he asked .	134.75857554690216
 The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his <unk> .	316.35197185815474
 Mitchell said the <unk> of the outcome in last fall 's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue .	383.0581168519277
 <unk> <unk> Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president .	417.48121502244555
 He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign , he said , because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into <unk> an old national campaign .	262.0528090097341
 The audience last night did not respond with either applause or <unk> to mention of Hughes ' remark .	503.10977218934215
 <unk> spoke on the merit of having an open primary .	259.7207590778842
 He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign .	142.01125893599803
 State aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industry .	598.4648663026637
 <unk> <unk> Mitchell <unk> the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the <unk> State Senate Must share the blame for this .	376.7039031837356
 Nothing that <unk> last year had lost the <unk> <unk> Co plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform .	250.46234042270302
 But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time , Mitchell said .	252.2528326224077
 Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his <unk> for Mitchell .	364.18973278336824
 He said Mitchell is against the <unk> of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises .	519.4089264716882
 He calls for help while saying he is against <unk> , but you ca n't have it both ways , Jones said .	224.960020743672
 The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue .	330.6622770087403
 <unk> <unk> <unk> , Mitchell said in a statement I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J Hughes .	615.3470432710413
 His reference to <unk> carcass ' or <unk> remains ' of the president 's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the <unk> intentions of the free nations .	204.3268448677353
 I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste .	650.8695348057145
 Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature .	325.14026582260726
 It can only <unk> to Mr Hughes ' <unk> .	127.38691137143338
 <unk> <unk> <unk> Sen Charles W Sandman , <unk> May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination .	609.5753919226407
 Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones .	1128.7063991076295
 Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party 's <unk> with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years .	422.4561613676098
 Sandman said The announcement that Sen Clifford Case <unk> , has decided to spend all his available time <unk> for Mr Mitchell is a dead <unk> .	565.4163311897966
 It is a desperate effort to <unk> up a <unk> candidate who has proven he can not answer any questions about New Jersey 's problems .	264.6291168705611
 We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington .	437.4431081143916
 That failed .	145.95743692519667
 We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr Mitchell some of the glow of Sen Case 's candidacy of last year .	628.589067695379
 That , too , will fail .	116.08722724046504
 Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs Harriet <unk> <unk> of 330 <unk> Ave , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee .	621.4912318614093

 County <unk> <unk> R Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper <unk> in those counties in the state which still use them .	311.50074982314555
 The proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a lip service word .	674.0796171701074
 Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge .	880.3029529468536
 Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January , <unk> .	306.3834858230027
 Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically <unk> , he added that the vital interest in election results <unk> county lines .	657.884689449096
 The candidacy of Mayor James J <unk> of West Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County , was supported today by Edward W <unk> , West Orange public safety commissioner .	1005.8492392758448
 <unk> , a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization 's candidate , <unk> William <unk> , for the vacancy left by the resignation of <unk> <unk> , now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals .	226.2187513134047
 My experience as public safety commissioner , <unk> said , has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer .	414.6076281496213
 Jim <unk> fits that description .	1474.3009114733668
 <unk> - William J <unk> , state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development , has retired after 36 years of service .	533.9959174284882

 In October 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section .	785.1442825852878
 Under his supervision , the state <unk> agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor <unk> and tractor units for fire fighting .	653.7678421481892
 He also expanded and <unk> the radio system with a central control station .	233.55487316175723
 He introduced regular <unk> sessions for district fire <unk> and first aid training for section <unk> .	676.3587098458917
 He is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education .	1006.0686298193586
 <unk> - Richard J Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a <unk> to carry the issues to every corner of the state .	525.0723413085469
 He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the <unk> Inn When I come back here after the November election you 'll think , 'You 're my man- you 're the kind of governor we 're glad we elected ' .	1017.2380685741182
 He said , We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time .	197.98832507933065
 <unk> <unk> In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said , The three Republican candidates for governor are <unk> over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary .	378.92770006594503
 But we 'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform .	370.5199303833279
 We 'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson .	181.12556041377462
 We 'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November .	152.67465010388653
 He said , You can see signs of the Republicans ' feeble attack on the Meyner administration .	363.3043632590714
 But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead .	206.86535354792576
 He urged New Jersey to become a full partner in the <unk> actions of President Kennedy .	344.15502278489487
 He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the <unk> of industry by Southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry .	227.93285890433256

 Hughes supported Gov Meyner 's Green <unk> plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development .	1553.3190573748386
 He said legislation for a 60 million bond issue to <unk> the program is expected to be introduced Monday .	293.04959380478425
 <unk> <unk> The plan will provide 45 million for purchase of open land by the state .	295.82254366372575
 The other 15 million is to be <unk> to municipalities on a matching fund basis .	274.9715185199246
 Hughes said , This is not a plan to <unk> <unk> but to <unk> it , pointing out the state population has increased <unk> each year since 1950 .	238.20381008589743
 He said Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve .	503.9513139964412
 Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved .	695.3469894746378
 He said no matter what stand he takes it would be <unk> that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans .	102.60852272750056
 After the primary , he promised , I 'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration .	254.23287471594136

 <unk> - Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are <unk> <unk> this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues .	427.9341610774349
 The outgoing members , whose <unk> terms will <unk> a week after the April 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory <unk> , to remember the state committee by .	666.2677177744099
 There may be other 1961 state committee <unk> come April 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters .	468.66563923564917
 A special presentation was made to Mrs <unk> Thompson of Red Bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee .	346.92603316357184
 She also was the original GOP national <unk> from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women 's suffrage amendment .	641.4721932583731
 She served one <unk> term on the national committee .	258.7738939947202
 <unk> <unk> up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R <unk> and Abraham D <unk> as running mates .	930.5653630996595
 At the same time reaction among <unk> Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor 's reported plan was generally favorable .	479.98614120349765
 Some <unk> Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years .	295.1006977620346
 The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor 's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders .	1248.4038235746757
 Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party .	888.720802986166
 <unk> <unk> Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr Wagner for the <unk> nomination in the Sept 7 Democratic primary .	1638.0501285260486
 These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city .	346.3844331273034
 Their view is that <unk> changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor .	440.1386893162174
 In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , Mr Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A Buckley , the Bronx Democratic leader , and with Joseph T <unk> , the Brooklyn Democratic leader .	1013.5189770510592
 <unk> <unk> <unk> As usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with <unk> G De <unk> , the Manhattan leader .	171.54655962333487
 He is publicly on record as believing Mr De <unk> should be replaced for the good of the party .	259.3866109750478
 Last night the Mayor visited Mr Buckley at the Bronx leader 's home for a discussion of the situation .	486.22144765130787
 Apparently he believes Mr Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization 's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle .	856.0366841678127
 In talks with Mr Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader 's <unk> to dropping Controller Lawrence E Gerosa , who lives in the Bronx , from this year 's ticket .	800.7572045715063
 But Mr Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr Gerosa 's successor .	326.4978094978044
 <unk> AND <unk> <unk> The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr <unk> , who lives in Queens , to replace <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr <unk> , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr Gerosa as the candidate for Controller .	261.6951328034161
 The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties <unk> on the Hunter College <unk> in the Bronx .	366.9666992001508
 After his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday 's New York Times .	302.2440464685877
 The Mayor said It did n't come from me .	179.82637462084986
 But as I have said before , if I announce my candidacy , I will have something definite to say about running mates .	280.6739345593462

 A political scientist writes of the growth of alienated voters , who believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control .	1329.7897906983387
 h These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to <unk> them .	273.9400439285422
 <unk> is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the <unk> of Edwin O'Connor 's novel , The Last <unk> .	208.43033310791446
 But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject .	149.35798749753124
 A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year .	588.7249156707197
 <unk> in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations .	256.5862509430632

 WASHINGTON , JUNE 18 - Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers .	2344.6472212439635
 In the Senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition .	324.9102011453783
 In the House , the <unk> coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration 's housing bill , while more <unk> is expected in an attempt to advance the <unk> bill .	183.5702654315357
 The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee .	411.2674864152369
 It is expected to be reported out Tuesday , but this is a little uncertain .	123.07515041805831
 The panel 's action depends on the return of Representative James W <unk> , Democrat of Arkansas , who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn 's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor .	493.6764410201123
 Mr <unk> has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday .	224.9927111272513
 <unk> IS <unk> The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans .	554.0059698121978
 The Democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week .	337.92256552044614
 The <unk> measure , which was passed last Monday by the Senate , provides for <unk> mortgages at low <unk> for <unk> families .	221.41418356334447
 It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories .	1961.6307332363328
 The education bill appears to be temporarily <unk> in the Rules Committee , where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are <unk> because of the religious controversy .	365.41784776030164
 They are James J <unk> of Queens and Thomas P <unk> Jr of Massachusetts .	421.8483707300447
 THREE <unk> TO <unk> What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill <unk> the National Defense Education Act of 1958 .	520.3350244106133
 This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other <unk> facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics .	654.95476719439
 Mr <unk> and Mr <unk> are not willing to vote on the <unk> measure until the defense education bill <unk> the House Education and Labor Committee .	324.72319149782254
 About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps .	505.0667834801964
 In the <unk> budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval , <unk> would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies .	329.1616587483701
 <unk> projects proposed by private groups are at the <unk> stage , Gordon <unk> , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a Washington interview .	267.8150725972749
 Six of these were proposed by religious groups .	439.1587307896892
 They will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin America .	501.976754326082
 QUESTION <unk> <unk> with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals .	411.345406930305
 There are a number of ways this could happen , the <unk> pointed out , and here is an example Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled .	357.717094889997
 When he protested , the hotel owner said Why do you worry ?	796.7748773558571
 The U S Government is paying for it .	293.526958814656
 The U S Government pays for all its overseas workers .	666.162672314041

 The hotel owner <unk> .	290.9223355118758
 <unk> thing , he said .	47.9608357355829
 And then , some <unk> remarked , there is a more classical <unk> problem Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ?	794.2782593035279
 R Sargent Shriver Jr , director of the corps , is certain that they can .	469.28792141042385
 No religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive Peace Corps funds unless it <unk> all <unk> on the project it proposes .	421.93863421638844
 <unk> , JUNE 18 - At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia , Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming Look , he took everything I had !	836.7885055381671

 Indonesia is one of the twenty <unk> countries of Asia , Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid .	499.7741518427274
 The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the <unk> nations .	351.1747362735122
 The Communist countries <unk> more than <unk> in economic aid alone last year , according to Western estimates .	371.5535377072564
 This was the biggest annual <unk> since the Communist program for the <unk> countries made its modest beginning in 1954 .	239.3668862771162
 In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries .	930.5691765624458
 UNITED <unk> , N Y , JUNE 18 - A committee of experts has recommended that a country 's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations .	429.55267504874274
 This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations .	441.7773058111714
 One effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India .	288.8919933403148
 India is the most populous United Nations member with more than <unk> inhabitants .	865.4705965907676
 The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report .	289.1691388400799

 Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western <unk> who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth <unk> session of the <unk> conference on the future of Laos .	229.5171442391607
 An agreement among the <unk> on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats conceded .	594.0063566190075

 The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week .	538.5407731924757
 Princess <unk> , Prince Souvanna Phouma 's young daughter , read the <unk> ' statement .	755.1263614939462
 They had a two-hour luncheon together in an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation , she said .	469.67000775398884
 The three <unk> agreed upon a <unk> agenda for their talks , which are to last three days .	196.67972157950035
 The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days .	292.718415028207
 TO <unk> WITH <unk> The meetings in <unk> , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government .	239.68282024774592

 Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned .	4446.257300402152
 The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department .	292.17996041565686
 He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen <unk> school , <unk> High school and <unk> business college .	283.03689073539584

 They <unk> at <unk> Miles <unk> WASHINGTON - <unk> of <unk> seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan 20 .	614.6218465424619
 Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this <unk> as President John F Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the <unk> ceremonies and ride down this historic <unk> route .	1701.7100202096206
 Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint .	359.64627234273433
 But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it .	843.6806464192322
 MANY <unk> Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government 's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments .	680.7384298687434
 Of course , <unk> Pennsylvania , the White House , is the most famous address of the free world .	124.81932954885231
 Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about <unk> high .	859.7467133813367
 Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about <unk> years old .	383.5232892855835
 In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade .	864.8864110378713
 They were the <unk> and they wanted to vote .	63.347716735183816
 In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time .	236.0150092066267
 <unk> ON SQUARE Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National <unk> building where hundreds of thousands of this country 's most valuable records are kept .	998.1488854945513
 Also the department of justice building is located where J <unk> Hoover <unk> over the federal bureau of investigation .	561.8925629332578
 Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania , <unk> with lines that are underground .	593.5402522668596
 Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points <unk> Lafayette Square , opposite the White House .	1617.783032683318
 In this historic square are several statutes , but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen Andrew Jackson , hero of the Battle of New Orleans .	405.9553105481015
 Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units .	1575.4466220405782
 About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade .	446.1448415822581
 Division one of the parade will be the service <unk> .	169.21050335009286
 Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas , the respective states of the President and of <unk> L B Johnson .	346.3383781264554
 Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union .	185.68156856133012
 Division three will be headed by the <unk> followed by 12 states ; division four will be headed by the Navy , followed by 11 states ; division five , by the Air Force followed by 11 states .	693.5242760313796

 <unk> , <unk> - What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi ?	481.5587440196138
 Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state 's immediate political future .	332.6590610481571
 This is largely because of the <unk> of the man who operates the <unk> of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million <unk> Gov Ross Barnett .	216.40812133914892
 Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well .	708.7919625856184
 Consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year .	763.8866978057054
 <unk> BE <unk> Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .	759.2294884481588
 The <unk> <unk> of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of <unk> and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his <unk> quest for the governor 's office .	253.2855757903428
 There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a <unk> .	435.10612366058206
 Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a <unk> of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the 1960 legislative session .	516.8762483490856
 If Barnett does n't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session .	225.36424501127578
 The odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year .	371.52691279580506
 <unk> ISSUE <unk> always get restless for a special session whether for the <unk> or the <unk> per <unk> is not certain and if they start <unk> .	207.68530550828555
 Barnett is not expected to be able to <unk> the pressure .	69.89415385387169
 The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state 's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .	508.34856397231243
 With eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E Smith as the one most likely to go , the <unk> battle will put to a test the <unk> power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature .	464.81876321423675
 Mississippi 's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House .	302.41417755952864
 <unk> badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party <unk> and <unk> , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a <unk> .	454.72543836951286
 And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together .	184.60842440692937
 FUTURE <unk> Barnett , as the <unk> head of the Democratic party , apparently must make the move to <unk> relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the <unk> ranks to completely <unk> him as a party <unk> .	194.16098824265475
 With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election .	599.4880002817681
 Now , the picture is <unk> , and even US <unk> James O <unk> and John C <unk> , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status .	189.21962965856468
 Reports are that it is more than probability that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen .	510.9358319113785
 <unk> <unk> , <unk> - The Gov <unk> H Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor 's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses .	378.9730966247652
 The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue .	515.8157349963549
 But it might give way shortly to another <unk> <unk> that of finances in state government .	305.2497777534868
 The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent .	585.1324955916133
 The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program .	358.66436755351685
 But the <unk> of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation .	377.2012946341289
 <unk> <unk> Indeed , the administration 's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat .	254.74295002628364
 The administration could not say why 28 million was needed for a <unk> program .	192.96453499162905
 The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the <unk> revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can <unk> the required two-thirds vote .	416.1732056229917
 The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature <unk> .	288.6677868529095
 Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to <unk> .	308.02813991734587
 If it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration .	183.38292924724837
 He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature .	237.01245865117187
 Actually , Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway .	609.9488682745321
 Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the <unk> losing battle to block token integration .	1545.187642449409
 This is not the sort of thing most <unk> would care to acknowledge publicly .	282.3409683382144
 They would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be <unk> .	167.48670109719865
 <unk> <unk> <unk> of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition .	243.24296904384545
 He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle .	170.33096738275592
 Then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the 28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period .	484.27838907637073
 It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that 28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one .	160.54659382530372
 But if the administration should find it does not need the 28 million for a <unk> program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes .	236.65810766947786
 This would be in perfect <unk> with the underlying concern in the <unk> the shortage of cash .	124.21750313992874
 It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .	265.2721831491052
 If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma .	396.86818802031775
 Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or <unk> its estimates of anticipated revenues .	660.7060410641291
 <unk> PROBLEM In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another <unk> at raising additional revenues through a tax <unk> .	316.4708572454761
 The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor .	564.245863441997
 It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem .	174.593311742359
 But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature .	413.3310263432804
 This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the <unk> to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more <unk> to a tax proposal later in the year .	132.6729327042973
 A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to <unk> .	373.01434396730286
 Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations <unk> to profit themselves .	944.4527048227806
 The new year might see some <unk> , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms .	383.80119186084676

 This year , coach Royal told me if I 'd work on my <unk> he thought he could use me , said Moritz .	400.3949635421463
 So I started practicing on it in spring training .	622.545293157787

 One was on a <unk> screen pass from the <unk> 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon 's territory .	397.4257899548804
 As soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it , Meek said .	507.7323425715795
 He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy halfback Terry <unk> had time to turn around .	685.9980514012591
 He really <unk> him h he nailed it for a yard loss .	209.35616364884658
 The Air Force 's , and the game 's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob <unk> which Gannon <unk> on his own <unk> and returned 22 yards .	449.49334691576223
 He just lay back there and waited for it , Meek said .	292.69244686436133
 He almost brought it back all the way .	162.00145552224853
 Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and <unk> Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice .	3154.4909326360194
 Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game , Meek said .	753.7912158566659
 He 'll be out of action all this week .	123.93527195451023
 He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game .	251.66686290276104

 Rice has not played since <unk> a knee in the opener with Maryland .	598.8325829876923
 He 's looking a lot better , and he 's able to run , Meek explained .	225.4698141542748

 The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League <unk> a <unk> triumph over the Denver <unk> but their visit will be a short one .	621.3018759736316
 The Texans have two more road <unk> at Buffalo and <unk> before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank Stram 's men will meet the <unk> just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in <unk> <unk> .	284.8677396853577
 Buffalo coach <unk> Ramsey , who has become one of the game 's greatest collectors of <unk> , apparently now has found a productive pair in two <unk> Football <unk> , M C Reynolds and Warren <unk> .	366.93423578144547
 <unk> , the former Louisiana State field general , came off the bench for his debut with the <unk> Sunday and directed his new team to a <unk> upset victory over the Houston <unk> , defending league champions .	492.9643943693136
 Just our luck !	1494.0159493008707
 exclaimed Stram .	4852.045044113131
 <unk> would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way .	720.40681941925
 Ramsey has a thing or two to <unk> about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous <unk> without the <unk> of a top star , Jack <unk> , though he did the team 's <unk> while nursing a knee injury .	298.77994271769103
 Our interior line and out <unk> played exceptionally well , said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game .	1151.6281877934584
 In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job .	380.320042565362
 The Texans won the game through ball control , with <unk> Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes .	1671.8816295173715
 We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack , explained Stram .	521.5194989867435
 They can be going along , doing little damage , then <unk> , <unk> they can hit a couple of passes on you for <unk> and put you in trouble .	177.14064282820036
 The <unk> did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off .	239.58092218058118
 The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> halfback .	162.68028555940006
 He was called upon 26 <unk> more than all of the other <unk> <unk> and delivered <unk> yards .	132.60706319364684
 The Texans made themselves a <unk> break on the opening <unk> when Denver 's Al <unk> was <unk> loose from the ball when Dave <unk> , the <unk> halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas .	466.3239927221958
 A quick touchdown resulted .	1333.7756687344033

 <unk> <unk> made a spectacular play on <unk> 's <unk> in the hole in the fourth and <unk> came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base .	198.62843632455917

 I know when my reflexes are gone and I 'm not going to be any <unk> man on the ball club .	175.19542107470073
 This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden <unk> .	137.27790321288663
 Jensen got only six hits in 46 <unk> for a <unk> batting average in the first 12 games .	686.7667842319557

 You 'll probably get a ball bat on the head .	221.0469261713989
 He 's mad at the world .	86.91985664218666
 But Jackie had gone into the station .	223.50299271189817
 Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand .	381.61361669252426
 I told him who I was and he was quite cold .	141.55651821530654
 But he warmed up after a while .	254.9549388125974
 I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a <unk> and said anything he Liston got was through a <unk> .	269.8067892023288
 He said he had never talked to Liston .	151.32775069477572
 Liston is Bill Liston , baseball writer for the Boston <unk> , who quoted Jensen as saying I ca n't hit anymore .	1311.8716513718423
 I ca n't run .	116.89969546780915

 <unk> WHEN IT <unk> baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up <unk> <unk> to start millions of <unk> to <unk> .	316.98912026378514
 And so it was over the weekend what with <unk> Warren Spahn pitching his <unk> masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants ' Willie Mays <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> Sunday .	424.687478891472
 Both , of course , were remarkable <unk> and further <unk> the fact that baseball <unk> is the national pastime .	161.98952331140094
 Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's <unk> pitching probably reached the most hearts .	933.7680284588934
 It was a real <unk> to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the <unk> milestone .	160.24649954720246
 And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , <unk> I was 40 , and a <unk> big <unk> .	152.58342745584224
 THE <unk> AND <unk> Spahn waved off his new <unk> as one of those good days .	174.489408364289
 But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the <unk> great <unk> in the game 's history .	235.60706034522343
 Yes , with Bob Grove , Carl <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Art <unk> , Vernon <unk> , et al .	162.1238128095025
 Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a <unk> fine fellow , a ball player 's ball player , as they say in the trade .	465.0418595052513
 I remember his <unk> performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of <unk> .	487.1140092720938
 <unk> DOES N'T <unk> how to merely go through the motions , remarked <unk> <unk> , another all-out guy , who played <unk> that day and <unk> one over the clubhouse .	342.2994795825204
 The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 , joined six other <unk> who <unk> four home runs in a span of nine <unk> .	557.5521148587362
 Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience .	304.14653285059865
 Bobby <unk> of Boston was the first to hit four at home and <unk> Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn 's <unk> Field .	471.78233142472646

 <unk> 'S BIG DAY <unk> the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle .	910.0629315799558
 This is an issue which <unk> down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you 're an American or National fan and <unk> or <unk> .	154.5257487723195
 The record books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace .	322.5961151846342
 In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases .	1620.3716590579204
 Once the figure was <unk> .	51.213224728007106
 Willie 's lifetime batting average of <unk> is 11 points beyond Mickey 's .	2064.63381624473
 The Giants who had been <unk> with the bat in their <unk> <unk> Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park .	203.73462054662792
 It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump .	1556.462446731291
 THE <unk> TV audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob <unk> that the games are not to be <unk> out when his Bears are playing at home .	388.5400999345214
 This rule providing for a <unk> of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game 's top rulers .	652.0843273886236
 The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the Living Room <unk> Club when games were cut off .	602.3371642775471
 Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy .	268.2672603755468
 This year , I am told , the <unk> network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here .	274.2184723631755
 There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .	474.2219266954331
 It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level .	604.2253186314562
 You would be surprised how many fans <unk> stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy .	758.8223382725761
 This dissatisfaction led to <unk> 's request that the <unk> not be terminated before the end of the game .	145.2948371479908
