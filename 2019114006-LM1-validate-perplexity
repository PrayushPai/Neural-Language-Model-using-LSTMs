 Damp also .	476.15353864284657
 He looked around the room and then called out Come here , quick ?	477.0137256398813
 What is it ?	99.69925515491197
 Barbara asked , standing in the doorway .	141.76593046222226
 I 've solved the mystery of the little bag .	370.4353334544173
 There it is h and there is what was in it .	133.26862539384345
 But where do people go swimming in Paris ?	957.0250967376808
 That boat in the river , maybe .	268.85523185081195
 What boat ?	1213.8218356402626
 There 's a big boat anchored near the Place de la Concorde , with a swimming pool in it- did n't you notice it ?	835.6848962291402
 But if he has time to go swimming , he had time to be with us .	126.23889048492775
 She looked at him in surprise .	227.9816656611899
 I know , he said , reading her mind .	148.75828469016957
 I do n't know what I 'm going to do with you .	292.66460547625314
 It 's because we are in France , he said , and know so few people .	173.4746858201977
 So something like this matters more than it would at home .	453.4979654273593
 Also , he was so nice when he was nice .	198.51705058055634
 All because I did n't feel like dancing .	545.3765948699457
 I do n't think it was that , really .	253.08250643016453
 Then what was it ?	126.46555241719598
 I do n't know .	127.67722277159965
 I wish I did .	372.1618779536267
 The tweed coat , maybe .	168.5442081724063
 The thing about Eugene is that he 's very proud .	327.95593693340595
 And the thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing suit pointed out , is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be .	538.3202028584561
 For instance- what about all those people Harold Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly , as if this were the one moment they would ever have together , their one chance of knowing each other ?	549.9596853766475
 Fortunately , the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered , or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields .	407.66783590054473
 And in any case , answers may clarify but they do not change anything .	461.92236268686077
 h he brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes , of about a hundred pounds ' weight .	209.6828308302875
 They took Jesus 's body , then , and wrapped it in winding-clothes with the spices ; that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial .	284.93079422145996
 Listed as present at the Descent were Mary , Mary 's sister , Mary Magdalene , John , Joseph of Arimathea , Nicodemus .	142.34261838238916
 Search as he might , he could find no place where the Bible spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus .	277.8292869810266
 Mostly the scene was crowded with mourners , such as the dramatic Dell'Arca Lamentation in Bologna , where the grief-stricken spectators had usurped Mary 's last poignant moment .	116.97898040974653
 In his concept there could be no one else present .	366.84718698664693
 His first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe .	267.74714401636913
 When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap ?	711.436680829199
 Perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground , while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate 's asking for Christ 's body , Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes , and the others had gone home to mourn .	158.36916340037942
 Those who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses .	148.8166176525504
 They would feel what Mary was undergoing .	581.8101398737139
 There would be no halos , no angels .	104.64709752014534
 These would be two human beings , whom God had chosen .	422.94729893537465
 He felt close to Mary , having spent so long concentrating on the beginning of her journey .	390.1508700291809
 Now she was intensely alive , anguished ; her son was dead .	400.72332890722777
 Even though he would later be resurrected , he was at this moment dead indeed , the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross .	271.7713305661956
 In his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt for his mother ; only what Mary felt for her son .	429.4279026144362
 Jesus ' inert body would be passive , his eyes closed .	472.21345794981244
 Mary would have to carry the human communication .	440.5771428785781
 This seemed right to him .	142.49304224960215
 It was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems .	194.42099813859969
 Since his Christ was to be life size , how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming ungainly ?	473.28871952137
 His Mary would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion , yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child .	219.48908448884083
 There was only one way to accomplish this by design , by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept .	342.2159633572311
 He started by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper .	512.4461623814115
 Visually , these approximated what he was feeling within himself .	135.35676845967959
 At the same time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping at the stalls , storing up fresh impressions of what they looked like , how they moved .	257.5575249137528
 In particular he sought the gentle , sweet-faced nuns , with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads , remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper .	233.64696457824465
 Discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a study of the anatomy of folds .	128.34206561591608
 He improvised as he went along , completing a life-size clay figure , then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber , to the consistency of thick mud .	213.85191059321224
 No fold could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the Madonna 's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive support to Christ 's body , to intensify her inner turmoil .	229.07547287608614
 When the cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made .	150.7137891849955
 So that 's sculpture , commented Argiento wryly , when he had sluiced down the floor for a week , making mud pies .	249.80145415597227
 Michelangelo grinned .	357.4857378127972
 See , Argiento , if you control the way these folds are bunched , like this , or made to flow , you can enrich the body attitudes .	211.82500824475517
 They can have as much tactile appeal as flesh and bone .	464.6131985635476
 He went into the Jewish quarter , wanting to draw Hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how Christ might have looked .	484.5727858116743
 The Jewish section was in Trastevere , near the Tiber at the church of San Francesco a Ripa .	74.23950720315679
 The colony had been small until the Spanish Inquisition of 1492 drove many Jews into Rome .	343.43360915411455
 Here , for the most part , they were well treated , as a reminder of the Old Testament heritage of Christianity ; many of their gifted members were prominent in the Vatican as physicians , musicians , bankers .	387.52201724631925
 The men did not object to his sketching them while they went about their work , but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to pose .	223.12785702926135
 He was told to ask for Rabbi Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon .	248.15304980667415
 Michelangelo found the rabbi in the room of study , a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey eyes , robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head .	183.6258924706649
 He was reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his congregation .	78.83554440541363
 When Michelangelo explained why he had come , Rabbi Melzi replied gravely The Bible forbids us to bow down to or to make graven images .	557.4002843299701
 That is why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture .	519.5091870516046
 But , Rabbi Melzi , you do n't object to others creating works of art ?	587.4220054098412
 Not at all .	168.3189599265861
 Each religion has its own tenets .	193.81956876713826
 I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble .	179.34067385872387
 I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew .	1006.308441614541
 I can not accomplish this if you will not help me .	320.95461865426347
 The rabbi said thoughtfully , I would not want my people to get in trouble with the Church .	213.05806449688973
 I am working for the Cardinal of San Dionigi .	276.3255227118881
 I 'm sure he would approve .	611.3208924204897
 What kind of models would you prefer ?	1069.9384751441114
 Workmen .	27.73379222402555
 In their mid-thirties .	31.025284190026063
 Not bulky laborers , but sinewy men .	384.95516248545806
 With intelligence .	364.2213224881717
 And sensitivity .	337.7345132154886
 Rabbi Melzi smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes .	904.0274283488335
 Leave me your address .	356.89330681202034
 I will send you the best the quarter has to offer .	500.78990138957465
 Michelangelo hurried to Sangallo 's solitary bachelor room with his sketches , asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated Madonna .	284.3683384490855
 Sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle couch .	205.5096756869361
 Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber .	1571.2600394276283
 Together he and Argiento built the stand , covering it with blankets .	382.3774609257352
 His first model arrived at dusk .	220.93188153311368
 He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to disrobe , so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins , led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes .	121.3966437284181
 He then draped him over the rough stand , explained that he was supposed to be recently dead , and was being held on his mother 's lap .	277.74657269220467
 The model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; only the instructions from his rabbi kept him from bolting .	339.3404602421692
 But at the end of the sitting , when Michelangelo showed him the quick , free drawings , with the mother roughed in , holding her son , the model grasped what Michelangelo was after , and promised to speak to his friends h. He worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi .	279.70796603633113
 Mary presented quite a different problem .	905.8713460773075
 Though this sculpture must take place thirty-three years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive of her as a woman in her mid-fifties , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry .	335.4982705652814
 His image of the Virgin had always been that of a young woman , even as had his memory of his mother .	152.49712274113273
 Jacopo Galli introduced him into several Roman homes .	323.1188527619091
 Here he sketched , sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk , young girls not yet twenty , some about to be married , some married a year or two .	331.36067043612667
 Since the Santo Spirito hospital had taken only men , he had had no experience in the study of female anatomy ; but he had sketched the women of Tuscany in their fields and homes .	129.0623716524311
 He was able to discern the body lines of the Roman women under their robes .	113.26347968289848
 He spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together a Mary who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; and a Jesus who , though lean , was strong even in death h a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of Santo Spirito .	503.20701188240935
 He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketches .	1016.4262067323416
 Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay .	349.00587012753516
 Here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to distort forms .	264.4914278966139
 When he wanted to emphasize , or get greater intensity , he added or subtracted clay .	302.22158113838714
 Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence .	337.0862937502779
 He respected each of these approach techniques , and kept them in character his quill drawings had a scratchiness , suggesting skin texture ; the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an abdomen , in a reclining torso ; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull .	547.166775396085
 Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; they remained rough starting points .	711.6145049347697
 When carving he was charged with spontaneous energy ; too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model .	394.05919914054994
 The true surge had to be inside the marble itself .	475.55421684580887
 Drawing and models were his thinking .	197.8110544689926
 Carving was action .	43.06897321690389
 10 .	966.7876413825456
 The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice .	343.461552102228
 Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal .	336.58397903221095
 Argiento , this is senseless , he complained , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather .	211.1523107137677
 You 're too clean .	893.3770104590691
 Scrub the studio once a week .	293.51784566439335
 That 's enough .	116.02962889082589
 No , said Argiento stolidly .	59.49970317012415
 Every day .	397.9339655260764
 Before dawn .	1236.0911923256347
 I was taught .	139.27631648926376
 And God help anyone who tries to unteach you !	740.2449695421055
 grumbled Michelangelo ; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble about , for Argiento made few demands on him .	204.05545326921956
 The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome .	423.64543243713075
 On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses .	287.2653926474488
 The one thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by announcing Today I go see the horses .	432.6838366579619
 It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him .	173.7501855041768
 He was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim , when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil .	207.26218220272781
 He stumbled into the house , eyes burning like fire .	427.7576859917962
 Argiento made him lie down on the bed , brought a pan of hot water , dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter .	304.14378055877086
 Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned .	179.6212438498923
 He assumed he could blink the splinter out .	63.07530121493837
 But it would not come .	57.0444325798119
 Argiento never left his side , keeping the water boiled , applying hot compresses throughout the night .	385.57732208254384
 By the second day Michelangelo began to worry ; and by the second night he was in a state of panic he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye .	248.52442638031349
 At dawn Argiento went to Jacopo Galli .	105.79451043749845
 Galli arrived with his family surgeon , Maestro Lippi .	162.8416193453386
 The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons .	133.27763584232264
 He told Argiento to take a bird out of the cage , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood gush into Michelangelo 's injured eye .	276.45800011654313
 The surgeon came back at dusk , cut the vein of a second pigeon , again washed out the eye .	116.68293464333254
 Beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps .	147.22283445249136
 The thin legs twitched convulsively once , then Kate felt the little body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound .	393.3745686641307
 The scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands .	1764.8814352137363
 The child was gone .	102.5812619050838
 When Juanita awoke , Kate was still rocking the dead child , still crooning in disbelief , No , no , oh , no !	432.36989941237385
 They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian minister .	652.315980294964
 He sat beside Kate 's bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God 's will , while Kate lay staring angrily at him .	663.8641087871748
 When he told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words rebelliously .	301.7793340733114
 Few of the neighbors came , but Mrs Tussle came , called by tragedy .	257.5093501144354
 It always comes in threes , she sighed heavily .	320.36722843487723
 Trouble never comes but in threes .	135.07002766568843
 They held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot .	592.1062666358625
 Kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment .	254.40344537596076
 She would not accept the death of such a little child .	151.7646991104681
 God called her to Him , the minister had said .	349.28634559220063
 God would not do that , Kate thought stubbornly .	247.8062528282735
 Jonathan 's letter came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child 's death as another judgment from God against both Kate and himself .	339.92752900512943
 In blind panic of grief she accepted Jonathan 's dictum , and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by God .	372.16987723039483
 She held Jonathan 's letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed .	248.15589569329515
 She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son .	244.03954656825638
 Joel came and sat mutely with her , sharing her pain and anguish , averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom .	277.8086241059101
 Juanita and Mrs Tussle kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried .	1008.0595745991287
 When she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty .	606.3938617285309
 She disciplined herself daily to do what must be done .	603.2536683259066
 She had even steeled herself to keep Juanita upstairs in the nurse 's room off the empty nursery , although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance of the baby 's death .	434.8334725477498
 Juanita drooped about the place , wearing a haunted , brooding look , which Kate attributed to the baby 's death , until the day a letter came for her addressed to Miss Juanita Fitzroy , bearing a Grafton postmark .	210.03972708102387
 Seeing the slanting hand , Kate knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel .	269.4774758275719
 The Federal forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving to take all the mountains .	169.08079191132907
 Kate tried to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended , at what involvement existed for Juanita .	371.8353807197767
 Uncle Randolph and Joel had replanted the bottom lands with difficulty , for more of the slaves , including Annie , had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp .	210.91718757597297
 Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school .	293.70804530973743
 He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry .	193.38478907829727
 Kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss .	421.8590014858375
 She loved him and missed his company .	425.8940539606873
 Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own .	506.8606173521675
 What it was Kate could not fathom .	173.37708123452128
 He claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his cronies , but Kate had not smelled brandy on him since Mrs Lattimer 's funeral .	310.0910762235344
 Joel knew what he was about , however .	107.38926141853092
 You 're gon na get caught , she heard Joel say to Uncle Randolph by the pump one morning .	320.4103832806286
 Not this old fox , chuckled Uncle Randolph .	328.30738214444915
 Everybody knows I 'm just a harmless , deaf old man who takes to drink .	962.0815192286675
 I aim to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure .	306.10076210008486
 Whisky still , my foot , said Joel .	116.38913823756799
 You 're back there riding with the guerrillas , the Moccasin Rangers .	78.38095563601415
 Hush , said Uncle Randolph , smiling , or I 'll give you another black eye .	421.95428748477946
 He patted the eye Joel had had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads some days back .	228.25247490818714
 Kate had no idea what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night , had heard horsemen on the River Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn .	628.2209487620015
 Stranger , Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle , drunkenly singing Old Dan Tucker at the top of his voice .	280.78012116157475
 Hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road , Kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house , cold sober .	328.06877406752136
 What he was about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by General McClellan , threatening reprisals against Rebel guerrillas .	190.4338078614531
 She was taken up in worry for the reckless old man .	308.04944116843285
 Kate drew more and more on her affection for Joel through the hot days of summer work .	629.7827063321138
 She had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer , after she saw Miss Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom .	230.5930265047677
 Kate had walked past the school on her morning chores and had seen the whole incident , had seen Joel 's burning humiliation before Miss Snow 's cold , bespectacled wrath .	657.7901443008022
 He had the hardest pains of growing before him now , as he approached twelve .	333.86304710853415
 These would be his hardest years , she knew , and he missed his father desperately .	273.7747985443631
 She tried to find some way to draw him out , to help him .	185.60126340869797
 Whenever she found time , she went blackberry picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths purple , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day .	481.2649894337175
 He tended the new colts Beau had sired .	142.5641927390771
 He helped Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower garden in the side yard , where they sometimes sat in the still evenings watching the last fat bees working against the summer 's purple dusk .	873.43092960793
 No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph .	462.67446068918105
 They stayed in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the peddler , bringing the news .	208.50725538035886
 Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it ; of their first engagement at Falling Waters after Old Jack 's First Brigade had destroyed all the rolling stock of the BO Railroad .	549.79146214946
 The men were restive , he wrote , ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished .	193.23177885691132
 The peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in Wheeling , Which had formed a new state government by declaring the government at Richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors .	251.3778765593312
 Dangling his gaudy trinkets before them , he told of the Rebel losses in the mountains , at Cheat and Rich mountains both , and the Federal march on Beverly .	109.44024829978558
 Cleaned all them Rebs out'n the hills , they did !	316.6579354494701
 They wo n't never git over inter loyal western Virginia , them traitors !	545.1884969007417
 The Federals is making everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too , he crowed .	198.15156023450726
 After he had gone , Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly , Would you take their oath ?	737.7440565399093
 And the old man had given a sly and wicked laugh and said , Hell , yes !	185.6892298273859
 I think I 've taken it about fifty times already !	1396.6170782407883
 winking at Joel 's look of shock .	120.5753758786172
 Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate 's baby and at Jonathan 's decision to go with the South And , dear Kate , she wrote , poor Dr Breckenridge 's son Robert is now organizing a militia company to go South , to his good father 's sorrow .	832.4792576170636
 Maj Anderson of Fort Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the US Army .	322.13719499368494
 In spite of the fact that the state legislature voted us neutral , John Hunt Morgan is openly flying the Confederate flag over his woolen factory !	856.6732731107736
 Rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley .	207.1478326558748
 Accounts were garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg for the news .	230.79037203273015
 All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas Junction and it were a big fight , the old man told them .	149.7039643663448
 In the next few days they had cause to rejoice .	132.90901683310867
 It had been a big battle , and the Confederate forces had won .	197.21166281169684
 Jonathan and Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing .	156.36564250204643
 Kate and Mrs Tussle waited for letters anxiously .	742.1986835904231
 Joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate .	244.70844330692728
 When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful .	780.3198800544951
 They all prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come , for Virginia had defended her land victoriously .	470.8472208581959
 The week after Manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon 's rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window .	630.1499103351657
 They had already lost most of their corn , she thought .	322.84083522600855
 Were they to be insulted again because of the South 's great victory ?	187.72437330995479
 She remembered McClellan 's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs .	559.6989152193701
 At the landing she saw Juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door .	294.4529026732879
 Juanita stopped just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth .	338.6944330692303
 As Kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel Marsh framed in the doorway , his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita wore .	520.6166726429049
 Kate greeted him gravely , uneasy with misgivings at his visit .	964.4451644461377
 What brings you here again , Colonel Marsh ?	509.9748162719523
 she asked , taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun .	379.65731175236897
 I stopped to say goodbye , Mrs Lattimer , and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby .	262.88089016057137
 I wish our doctor could have saved her .	881.9048250678866
 It was a terrible loss to me , said Kate quietly , feeling the pain twist again at the mention , knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at Grafton .	332.35340673934655
 Where will you go now that you 're leaving Parkersburg ?	502.2799574545866
 she asked him , seeing Juanita 's eyes grow bleak .	783.9785861842167
 As you know , General McClellan has been occupying Beverly .	1049.5466004246007
 He has notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the Potomac .	97.2554571628706
 I am to go to Washington to serve with him .	146.54831985065394
 When are you to leave ?	276.1129166934658
 Kate asked , watching them both now anxiously .	617.7097582137668
 Their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions , she thought sadly .	821.0373495615645
 Tomorrow .	27.98676670904358
 Would you permit Juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell , Mrs Lattimer ?	334.36301351183243
 Stay here in the parlor where it 's cool , she said , trying to be calm .	200.90839595925144
 It would be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and Mrs Tussle not to see them .	129.27999337237569
 Kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations .	1093.5999668780053
 Then she took iced lemonade to Marsh 's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden .	300.8774472526649
 When Marsh called to his aide and the pair rode off down the River Road where the gentians burned blue , Juanita was shaken and trying not to cry .	486.2573621547722
 She sought Kate out upstairs , her lips trembling .	2306.147654679997
 He wants me to go with him tomorrow , she told Kate .	501.1404863322282
 What do you want to do ?	282.33821381586694
 Kate asked , uneasy at the gravity of the girl 's dilemma .	462.6189951011037
 I could go with him .	88.57703472146537
 He knows me as your niece , which , of course , I am .	215.4397669604208
 But I am a slave !	332.97447938599726
 You own me .	454.70199589533365
 It 's your decision , said Juanita , holding her face very still , trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly .	416.1682145820481
 No , the decision is yours .	209.46102436123323
 I have held your papers of manumission since I married Mr Lattimer .	340.4832452185422
 The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky .	134.60664450573955
 The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no more .	396.45117443705806
 The things left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows .	213.651991377673
 Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and then empty of images .	230.31694740216136
 They slept- Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring , the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table .	119.85706039000566
 In the ballroom below , the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows .	278.7839428892949
 It was a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky .	219.4610621427371
 Martha Schuyler , old , slow , careful of foot , came down the great staircase , dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk , her jeweled shoe buckles held forward .	318.1278078396469
 Well , I 'm here at last , she said , addressing the old portraits on the walls .	335.20156639613464
 I do n't hear the music .	185.31791541880744
 I am getting deaf , I must admit it .	585.76239461814
 She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that led down to it .	163.62695992498197
 Where is everyone ?	693.015746992567
 I say , where is everyone ?	288.4228181817059
 Peter , you lummox , you 've forgot to order the musicians .	333.2680376399847
 She stood there , a large old woman , smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning , this big foolish baby of a son .	284.1629061914999
 There were times now , like this , when she lost control of the time count and moved freely back and forth into three generations .	449.7541877881634
 Was it a birthday ball ?	1823.97958151043
 When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen ?	795.4214253634445
 Or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big house , a Van Rensselaer bride from way upstate near Albany , from Rensselaerwyck .	347.6109071061492
 And this handsome booby , staring and sweating , was he her bridegroom ?	117.38655477490713
 Martha picked up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom .	344.7228134495583
 David Cortlandt was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh .	412.3454319302577
 He had ridden hard from Boston , and he was not used to horseback .	57.20506152694866
 Now , driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler , he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move .	480.11698000555066
 The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather than the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood memories .	347.90938866656234
 He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held on as the sulky 's wheels hit a pothole and came out with a jolt and went on .	144.30278670857462
 He would cross to Manhattan , to Harlem Heights , before morning .	708.5361058555974
 There a certain farmhouse was a station for the Sons of Liberty .	164.75803098051975
 He would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news .	351.03627945029643
 And he would sleep , sleep , and never think of roads and horses ' sore haunches , of colonial wars .	454.94817339474656
 Strange how everything here fitted back into his life , even if he had been away so long .	250.95691522185888
 Mynheer , Sir Francis , the valley society , the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched road .	244.8004573116135
 A mist was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a blending and merging grace .	162.4942263644616
 Ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads .	289.91562408951324
 David reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags at his feet .	108.27126193754579
 He pulled out one of them and cocked it .	114.20630772212648
 A strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes .	1035.5937092650286
 It was a grotesque hen , five or six feet tall .	793.731348489502
 It had the features of a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers .	119.2972503249121
 It ran , this apocalyptic beast , on two thin legs , and its wings- were they feathered arms ? - flapped as it ran .	195.04055655584256
 Its groin was bloody .	32.884243426991645
 Black strips of skin hung from it .	1627.3504557944962
 The horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its nostrils .	98.53233724304562
 David took a firm hand with it .	410.3625785602705
 The creature in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes , glazed with an insane fear .	632.1146932358098
 The ungainly bird thing ran away , and to David its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster .	118.36555727162325
 Then it was gone .	89.88332075646326
 He drove on , wary and shaken .	287.65399099892363
 The Sons were out tonight .	510.41037750854207
 CHAPTER 10 New York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island .	428.64222763120824
 It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets , mostly around the Battery , going bravely north to Wall Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights .	473.9461825254521
 From there it looked across at Westchester County and the Hudson River where the manor houses , estates , and big farms of the original non-Indian landowners began .	171.0705766701329
 On the east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long Island Sound .	814.4827242551863
 On the western tip of Long Island protruded Brooklyn Heights .	1144.5772566668675
 It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor .	554.6758909279332
 A fringe of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights , and behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields .	487.74869865424023
 Husbandry was bounded by snake-rail fences , and there were grazing cattle .	161.71246898419452
 On the shores north and south , the fishers and mooncursers- smugglers- lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand , Fire Island .	437.12242390892976
 The morning hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay , sheltered by the Jersey inlets .	193.4525619909193
 They often threw tidbits overboard .	681.0482270336367
 The larger ships were near Paulus Hook , already being called , by a few , Jersey City .	313.8705013373439
 These were the ships of His Majesty 's Navy , herding the hulks of the East Indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the loyalists .	74.49200133539661
 The news of battle on Breed 's Hill had already seeped through , and New York itself was now left in the hands of the local Provincial Congress .	196.15819230765445
 The fish hawk , his wings not moving , circled and glided lower .	163.98198179063598
 The gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him , the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black , the bronze cannon at the ports .	305.02992070673156
 The captain 's gig of HMS Mercury was being rowed to HMS Neptune .	38.51278823334961
 On shore the freed slaves to despotism- the town dwellers- watched the ships and waited .	502.38755142777563
 The chevaux de frise , those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the Battery , pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in .	235.12641012847274
 Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber ; their rock paths led down to the Hudson .	789.5633854012373
 Below in the open bay facing Manhattan was Staten Island , gritty with clam shells and mud flats behind which nested farms , cattle barns , and berry thickets .	444.20709354066213
 Along Wappinger Creek in Dutchess County , past the white church at Fishkill , past Verplanck 's Point on the east bank of the Hudson , to the white salt-crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen .	337.4742247096241
 Today , tomorrow , six months , even perhaps a year h The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight .	582.3491912622252
 The British ships rolled at anchor , sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London .	1640.3861522581838
 Waited for more ships , more lobster-backed infantry , and asked what was to be done with a war of rebellion ?	222.87011889996415
 David Cortlandt , having slept away a day and a night , came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem River near Spuyten Duyvil .	224.83325597075216
 He looked out through windowpanes turned a faint violet by sun and weather , looked out at King 's Bridge toward Westchester .	350.58852787124545
 The road seemed animated with a few more wagons than usual ; a carriage raising up the choking June dust , and beyond , in a meadow , a local militia company drilling with muskets , Kentuck ' rifles , every kind of horse pistol , old sword , or cutlass .	396.0250248207491
 The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded David 's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston .	410.6032794140548
 Pensive , introspective , he ached .	13.455246004378873
 He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept .	152.57315325562496
 Now there was more to do .	138.92665455752157
 Orders not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government .	277.1434081083193
 He scratched his mosquito-plagued neck .	61.70083291758639
 From the saddlebags , hung on a Hitchcock chair , David took out a good English razor , a present from John Hunter .	248.44263426721838
 He found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap , and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt , its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost h. He hoped he was free of self-deception .	191.39018633964358
 Here he was , suddenly caught up in the delirium of a war , in the spite and calumny of Whigs and Tories .	131.64756783549655
 There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war .	290.56499552972554
 David Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface .	210.01116621131047
 He knew that many were using it for their own ends .	202.6222937305685
 But it did not matter .	95.46534826958703
 He stropped the razor slowly ; what mattered was that a new concept of Americans was being born .	133.41331244063977
 That some men did not want it he could understand .	305.5302590147438
 The moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers .	260.2269152946515
 Yet some , like Morris Manderscheid , would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas .	172.162258485151
 Unique circumstances would test us all , he decided .	281.30915356934287
 Injury and ingratitude would occur .	63.59779376043326
 No doubt John Hancock would do well now ; war was a smugglers ' heaven .	337.2996505269458
 And what of that poor tarred and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from Schuyler 's ?	176.48060484443766
 Things like that would increase rather than be done away with .	749.0031107238609
 One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing .	196.24263210356435
 He saw with John Hunter now that the perfectability of man was a dream .	148.4287720278797
 Life was a short play of tenebrous shadows .	265.47480974960024
 David began to shave with great sweeping strokes .	1073.774023236308
 Time plays an essential part in our mortality , and suddenly for no reason he could imagine or admit the image of Peg laughing filled his mind- so desirable , so lusty , so full of nuances of pleasure and joy .	565.433207833778
 He drove sensual patterns off , carefully shaving his long upper lip .	563.0231000164213
 It is harder , he muttered , to meditate on man or woman than on God .	221.97978766720885
 David finished shaving , washed his face clean of lather , and combed and retied his hair .	185.26707264171185
 He was proud that he had never worn a wig .	115.07956216753419
 More and more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder .	318.8307262360419
 He felt cheerful again , refreshed ; presentable in his wide-cut brown suit , the well-made riding boots .	219.7482830107912
 It is so easy to falsify sentiment h. In the meadow below , militia officers shouted at their men and on King 's Bridge two boys sat fishing .	871.9489552093064
 The future would happen ; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much .	322.4522037533607
 A man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days .	543.2531796412995
 He began to pack the saddlebags .	95.25528873852151
 And all this too shall pass away it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy- yes , in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal Hudson Valley , where a feeling of plenitude was normal in those English-Dutch manors with their well-fed squires .	240.04692469452087
 Burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on in a primitive way , almost unchanged from feudal times .	542.1326559086889
 Peasants puzzled Andrei .	110.05577967371923
 He wondered how they could go on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish .	565.6113179226912
 Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long ago .	350.67864320446745
 Tolek Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine and , before the national leadership , exalted the miracles of drying up swamps and irrigating the desert .	134.88939625930664
 A fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched .	692.8964415506047
 Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference .	206.0656366224752
 Had he found the meaning too late ?	752.4493128972833
 It aggravated him .	22.707716600463883
 The land of the Lublin Uplands was rich , but no one seemed to care .	83.97444559680778
 In the unfertile land in Palestine humans broke their backs pushing will power to the brink .	304.50238346982707
 He had sat beside Alexander Brandel at the rostrum of a congress of Zionists .	53.61547295449298
 All of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified ideologies , and each berated the other and beat his breast for his own approaches .	281.35770625342906
 When Alexander Brandel rose to speak , the hall became silent .	376.8896406114258
 I do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism .	356.83261947738407
 We are here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest , seeking human dignity .	1396.0834538853687
 Beyond the forest all our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren , eroded hills of Judea .	408.19262004301663
 This is our singular goal .	355.202160527646
 How we travel through the forest is for each man 's conscience .	351.57648661320826
 Where we end our journey is always the same .	457.6154146344337
 We all seek the same thing through different ways- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over Zion .	551.0265226801775
 This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism .	409.2862968896614
 It had sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it .	95.64709083483027
 In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine .	112.22798124045465
 He loathed the idea of drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright .	83.44746329222683
 Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex , I only want to be a Pole .	126.82310853300656
 Warsaw is my city , not Tel Aviv .	54.48696072019037
 And now Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief .	176.2840590386435
 Warsaw !	67.74017910246452
 He saw the smug eyes of the Home Army chief , Roman , and all the Romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him .	268.1278731866528
 They had let this black hole of death in Warsaw 's heart exist without a cry of protest .	476.13094314176055
 Once there had been big glittering rooms where Ulanys bowed and kissed the ladies ' hands as they flirted from behind their fans .	399.2855134931829
 Warsaw !	68.48272004588512
 Warsaw !	67.49346567420976
 Miss Rak .	102.897383307985
 I am a Jew .	168.64951305305576
 Day by day , week by week , month by month , the betrayal gnawed at Andrei 's heart .	402.3732798670523
 He ground his teeth together .	383.8390702951874
 I hate Warsaw , he said to himself .	82.74651042220651
 I hate Poland and all the goddamned mothers ' sons of them .	439.67955710832064
 All of Poland is a coffin .	127.76186199685641
 The terrible vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind .	796.3977380903782
 What matters now ?	708.9999107142497
 What is beyond this fog ?	489.4566022927944
 Only Palestine , and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe .	132.85759300946893
 By late afternoon the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at Lublin , which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the Russian front .	191.25031239574312
 At a siding , another train which was a familiar sight these days .	590.1502239990041
 Deportees .	27.835493670555003
 Jews .	2555.376344891337
 Andrei 's skilled eye sized them up .	182.48516293762253
 They were not Poles .	33.344176892625946
 He guessed by their appearance that they were Rumanians .	66.72402319398029
 He walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka .	79.06211968280287
 Of all the places in Poland , Andrei hated Lublin the most .	249.36201505890267
 The Bathyrans were all gone .	81.42177475203663
 Few of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto .	306.0443273479959
 From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point .	161.7916391572781
 He and Ana watched it carefully .	148.5703962803859
 Lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere .	133.8398272742248
 Early in 1939 , Odilo Globocnik , the Gauleiter of Vienna , established SS headquarters for all of Poland .	344.36976963410285
 The Bathyrans ran a check on Globocnik and had only to conclude that he was in a tug of war with Hans Frank and the civilian administrators .	205.7239111974919
 Globocnik built the Death's-Head Corps .	93.97814307910292
 Lublin was the seed of action for the final solution of the Jewish problem .	115.14235393165194
 As the messages from Himmler , Heydrich , and Eichmann came in through Alfred Funk , Lublin 's fountainhead spouted .	91.2579601075627
 A bevy of interlacing lagers , work camps , concentration camps erupted in the area .	213.6686184360885
 Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners of war disappeared into Lublin 's web .	430.66689608978044
 Plans went in and out of Lublin , indicating German confusion .	612.3372989566784
 A tale of a massive reservation in the Uplands to hold several million Jews h A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to the island of Madagascar h Stories of the depravity of the guards at Globocnik 's camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention of their names .	307.82552804528075
 Lipowa 7 , Sobibor , Chelmno , Poltawa , Belzec , Krzywy-Rog , Budzyn , Krasnik .	18.226811310098768
 Ice baths , electric shocks , lashings , wild dogs , testicle crushers .	69.46841288334303
 The Death's-Head Corps took in Ukrainian and Baltic Auxiliaries , and the Einsatzkommandos waded knee-deep in blood and turned into drunken , dope-ridden maniacs .	41.32456895629531
 Lublin was their heart .	55.70865431025331
 In the spring of 1942 Operation Reinhard began in Lublin .	229.38501844871055
 The ghetto , a miniature of Warsaw 's , was emptied into the camp in the Majdan-Tartarski suburb called Majdanek .	195.14238826306166
 As the camp emptied , it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around Lublin , then by deportees from outside Poland .	150.87105615901635
 In and in and in they poured through the gates of Majdanek , but they never left , and Majdanek was not growing any larger .	176.2276906751986
 What was happening in Majdanek ?	130.12700113201865
 Was Operation Reinhard the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw ?	421.5800936075744
 Was there another Majdanek in the Warsaw area , as they suspected ?	185.9880204789716
 Andrei stopped at Litowski Place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings .	441.0088976028391
 His watch told him he was still early .	449.4704724795907
 Down the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall .	251.93814509607566
 He found an empty bench , opened a newspaper , and stretched his legs before him .	390.11315402902625
 Krakow Boulevard was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their Auxiliaries .	266.1672706801212
 Captain Androfski !	899.3034972774861
 Andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the mustached , homely face of Sergeant Styka .	111.13874252319776
 Styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly .	126.04786593135995
 I have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn .	557.1878115087746
 I thought you might get in on a morning train .	394.7397032858562
 It 's good to see you again , Styka .	97.12955612179599
 Styka studied his captain .	264.25277451793477
 He almost broke into tears .	787.3950363872136
 To him , Andrei Androfski had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer .	155.03759566760291
 His captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby .	316.0119792122021
 Remember to call me Jan , Andrei said .	621.0732821440404
 Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously .	91.5371539212997
 When that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy since before the war .	520.7983571436874
 I 'm lucky that you were still living in Lublin .	275.7865943395721
 Styka grumbled about fate .	139.758767534977
 For a time I thought of trying to reach the Free Polish Forces , but one thing led to another .	513.650187218555
 I got a girl in trouble and we had to get married .	297.3586434449842
 Not a bad girl .	386.0459294728373
 So we have three children and responsibilities .	366.83158188346306
 I work at the granary .	39.05111850461303
 Nothing like the old days in the army , but I get by .	195.94128684820365
 Who complains ?	283.5661910831409
 Many times I tried to reach you , but I never knew how .	312.0715168681618
 I came to Warsaw twice , but there was that damned ghetto wall h I understand .	272.68824511009666
 Styka blew his nose again .	116.99481821364706
 Were you able to make the arrangements ?	197.8549966353547
 Andrei asked .	69.0161901907296
 There is a man named Grabski who is the foreman in charge of the bricklayers at Majdanek .	109.56160004878981
 I did exactly as instructed .	401.86069752175
 I told him you are on orders from the Home Army to get inside Majdanek so you can make a report to the government in exile in London .	270.11793044382557
 His answer ?	388.46866216191165
 Ten thousand zlotys .	550.8873161599072
 Can he be trusted ?	1690.7849679283697
 He is aware he will not live for twenty-four hours if he betrays you .	319.22118641930916
 Good man , Styka .	118.08545949954043
 Captain h Jan h must you go inside Majdanek ?	1927.8634736256743
 The stories h Everyone really knows what is happening there .	1615.12149164457
 Not everyone , Styka .	144.42270638009214
 What good will it really do ?	583.1257549040906
 I do n't know .	127.6906512919129
 Perhaps h perhaps h there is a shred of conscience left in the human race .	280.3771314302662
 Perhaps if they know the story there will be a massive cry of indignation .	256.9896660765887
 Do you really believe that , Jan ?	944.6077508915026
 I have to believe it .	110.95684002976661
 Styka shook his head slowly .	337.89516550619334
 I am only a simple soldier .	296.89859341120984
 I can not think things out too well .	276.804372161825
 Until I was transferred into the Seventh Ulanys I was like every other Pole in my feeling about Jews .	350.3078360762413
 I hated you when I first came in .	489.1823181445327
 But h my captain might have been a Jew , but he was n't a Jew .	184.69014909212967
 What I mean is , he was a Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys .	63.414670297406275
 Hell , sir .	141.82335424939419
 The men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name .	580.4869538326844
 You never knew about it , but by God , we taught them respect for Captain Androfski .	315.2084052028868
 Andrei smiled .	169.15791157919176
 Since the war I have seen the way the Germans have behaved and I think , Holy Mother , we have behaved like this for hundreds of years .	608.707535627161
 Why ?	529.3048168623646
 How can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see ?	567.7660456657668
 But we are neither blind nor insane .	1438.070283010043
 The men of your company would not allow your name dishonored .	231.6309716981768
 Why do we let the Germans do this ?	598.7291522320575
 I have sat many hours with this , Styka .	215.2213451353978
 All I ever wanted was to be a free man in my own country .	241.04676751982535
 I 've lost faith , Styka .	328.561166347528
 I used to love this country and believe that someday we 'd win our battle for equality .	621.5316475797317
 But now I think I hate it very much .	456.0729944925009
 And do you really think that the world outside Poland will care any more than we do ?	729.6788457367682
 The question frightened Andrei .	204.41417317644772
 Please do n't go inside Majdanek .	179.27281898333842
 I 'm still a soldier in a very small way , Styka .	155.05654224230352
 It was an answer that Styka understood .	112.63930132278563
 Grabski 's shanty was beyond the bridge over the River Bystrzyca near the rail center .	175.795385702318
 Grabski sat in a sweat-saturated undershirt , cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown .	185.83058328659305
 He was a square brick of a man with a moon-round face and sunken Polish features .	163.9398166630635
 Flies swarmed around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread .	189.28373893369582
 Half of it dripped down his chin .	319.1481989604271
 He washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch .	147.00399764232927
 Well ?	654.7431898380444
 Andrei demanded .	165.2248604731032
 Grabski looked at the pair of them .	67.66967034416187
 He grunted a sort of yes answer .	143.76489032198742
 My cousin works at the Labor Bureau .	953.7327561747962
 He can make you work papers .	357.77279369430863
 It will take a few days .	128.07981797866162
 I will get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew .	447.57402573837425
 I do n't know if I can get you into the inner camp .	267.9082265522241
 Maybe yes , maybe no , but you can observe everything from the roof of a barrack we are building .	384.42857637943723
 Grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup bowl .	111.71117063383161
 Ca n't understand why the hell anyone wants to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place .	541.4191221807195
 Orders from the Home Army .	196.7923658917608
 Why ?	531.9141255118849
 Nothing there but Jews .	926.741620235674
 Andrei shrugged .	14.873649243807261
 We get strange orders .	890.4730307745856
 Well- what about the money ?	149.10287362294125
 Andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty notes .	157.57968078707006
 Grabski had never seen so much money .	218.6436039216432
 His broad flat fingers , petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying , snatched the bills clumsily .	324.4387075655845
 This ai n't enough .	448.8312112267746
 You get the rest when I 'm safely out of Majdanek .	258.6316399789299
 I ai n't taking no goddamned chances for no Jew business .	685.3833526692517
 Andrei and Styka were silent .	68.57418180713238
 She was getting real dramatic .	896.0357123957693
 I 'd have been more impressed if I had n't remembered that she 'd played Hedda Gabler in her highschool dramatics course .	293.5675718155373
 I did n't want her back on that broken record .	460.31286338197526
 Nothing 's free in the whole goddam world , was all I could think of to say .	181.43664055244525
 When I 'd delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink .	498.0207335507849
 I am , she said .	135.01658722916213
 I 'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky Derby and how it was Thelma 's fifty dollars I was spending .	353.8890243616176
 It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days , and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch .	434.8066489126048
 Drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me .	270.9003369111271
 I was crazy about her all over again .	302.0743747101395
 It was the call of the wild all right .	129.19398647150905
 That evening turned out to be hell like all the others .	287.80736638869735
 We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill .	164.9451567129842
 It was the same old routine .	100.74522237626388
 Eileen got to dancing , just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed tune that you could hardly notice , and trying to pick up strange men , but each time I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she 'd pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet husky voice about the good times and the happiness we 'd had together and there I was back on the hook .	437.9529964127872
 I did have the decency to call up Thelma and tell her I 'd met old friends and would be home late .	570.1468675601043
 I could scratch her eyes out , Eileen cried and stamped her foot when I came back from the phone booth .	407.295986473115
 You know I do n't like my men to have other women .	363.0565232491742
 I hate it .	165.5504989976657
 I hate it .	166.11199066018054
 She got so drunk I had to take her home .	437.397965413428
 It was a walk up on Hudson Street .	249.63867744438093
 She just about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and would n't let me go .	774.8784356581178
 There was a man 's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table .	206.66656932807584
 The place smelt of some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use .	235.43456175392242
 What about Ballestre ?	111.41621196184751
 I had to shake her to make her listen .	334.449220095871
 Precious .	27.749332814344026
 What about him ?	167.12944185793071
 Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic .	769.3255873416157
 Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom .	628.4104770298534
 We are above being jealous .	181.12782062813645
 He 's used to me bringing home strange men .	716.9300676608756
 I 'll just tell him you 're my husband .	685.1870513850746
 He ca n't object to that .	258.64608465607586
 Well I object .	641.1493162899562
 If he pokes his nose in here I 'll slug him .	349.3834481316471
 That really would be funny .	368.23389232339963
 She began to laugh .	460.35839265033655
 She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed .	692.3211364670926
 After all I 'm made of flesh and blood .	459.76861687637324
 I 'm not a plaster saint .	429.43436883738696
 Waking up was horrible .	144.80458325599778
 Never in my life have I felt so remorseful about anything I 've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife .	578.8453511628805
 We both had hangovers .	77.16250513767388
 Eileen declared she could n't lift her head from the pillow .	243.29679872823004
 She lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot .	355.67940381768295
 I was stumbling in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when I smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell .	233.57712079036762
 There was somebody else in the apartment .	186.04079160854837
 I stiffened .	32.02074061690216
 Honest I could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a dog 's that is going to get into a fight .	279.5297922253658
 I turned around with the percolator in my hand .	97.68175841375765
 My eyes were so bleary I could barely see him but there he was , a little smooth olivefaced guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora .	217.4301643461628
 Brown eyes , eyebrow mustache .	127.03175725376752
 Oval face without an expression in the world .	142.27029396003303
 We did n't have time to speak before Eileen 's voice was screeching at us from the bed .	147.92883732253244
 Joseph Maria Ballestre meet Francis Xavier Bowman .	953.6053009930683
 Exboyfriend meet exhusband .	79.03554066769969
 She gave the nastiest laugh I ever heard .	381.8261768585776
 And do n't either of you forget that I 'm not any man 's property .	346.7235109832891
 If you want to fight , go down on the sidewalk .	186.96949515381633
 She was enjoying the situation .	187.19299856863083
 Imagine that .	65.07589681518849
 Eileen was a psychologist all right .	191.01397613409034
 Instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard I found myself having a fellowfeeling for him .	398.3954470664126
 Maybe he felt the same way .	142.96510254092755
 I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life .	105.79804786153021
 First thing I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and I was handing Eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers .	276.2008485306098
 I could n't face Thelma after that night .	263.5067820785553
 I did n't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone .	297.6446655038706
 I wrote her that I 'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express .	673.0534970221437
 Of course I had to give her Eileen 's address , but she never came near us .	259.70292188691514
 All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever .	563.9032658442131
 She never said a word about the fifty dollars .	365.91299354920164
 She added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking .	531.2657302377097
 I must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times .	307.98471430405027
 Afterwards I learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband away .	209.95158576326332
 That finished me with Thelma .	150.95509058855757
 Trust Eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation .	147.15073972562638
 And there I was shacked up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street .	375.20330979495606
 I use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship .	609.70103537101
 I felt it and it ate on me all the time , but I did n't know how right I was till later .	295.6754257732035
 What I did know was that Precious was always around .	120.44719240912961
 He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs .	169.5909501742359
 Who do you think pays the rent ?	1724.4394078062005
 You would n't have me throw the poor boy out on the street , Eileen said when I needled her about it .	209.33183909477478
 I said sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention .	458.73265862330965
 Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening to things she did n't want to hear .	286.5719348744009
 Still I did n't think she was twotiming me with Precious right then .	322.8380617678326
 To be on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night .	457.4396746905711
 Precious had me worried .	202.3913715334388
 I could n't make out what his racket was .	129.1605932125979
 I 'd thought him a pimp or procurer but he did n't seem to be .	129.22603297164025
 He was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his selfeffacing manner .	390.59546116675114
 Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet .	182.96743805024528
 Whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious who did the work .	313.9907777044423
 I never could find out what his business was .	268.1688787098637
 He always seemed to have money in his pocket .	223.9602770253239
 The phone had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger .	245.70544498545019
 Now and then he would disappear for several days .	349.42746726988827
 Connections was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions .	624.6858340549462
 Oh he 's just an international spy , Eileen would shout with her screechy laugh .	300.36998681610953
 Poor devil he ca n't have been too happy either .	1418.625340094958
 He got no relief from drink because , though sometimes Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening , he 'd leave it on the table untouched .	375.0462927651903
 When I was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess .	1061.3959931557627
 Occasionally if I pushed him too far he 'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his .	1086.999895943123
 Some day , I told Eileen , that guy will kill us both .	374.1149305645623
 She just would n't listen .	401.41939148929396
 Getting drunk every night was the only way I could handle the situation .	471.37637961418807
 Eileen seemed to feel the same way .	93.6662594943171
 We still had that much in common .	170.9851062688728
 The trouble was drinking cost money .	726.1840681888281
 The way Eileen and I were hitting it up , we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening .	527.9587179485275
 Eileen must have wheedled a little out of Precious .	58.204684113645264
 I raised some kale by hocking the good clothes I had left over from my respectable uptown life , but when that was gone I did n't have a cent .	289.63686439512094
 I do n't know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer had n't come to town .	307.41404354351073
 Pat O'Dwyer looked like a heavier Jim .	962.9588440284834
 He had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he did n't have Jim 's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm .	318.9325321204988
 He was a big thick beefy violent man .	294.54896413920295
 Now Pat may have been a lecher and a plugugly , but he was a good churchgoing Catholic and he loved his little sister .	144.27616828959088
 Those O'Dwyers had that Irish clannishness that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything .	407.7780145369864
 Pat took Eileen and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again .	354.7646663774656
 Whom God hath joined etcetera .	667.683536348584
 The O'Dwyers were real religious people except for Kate .	579.8781408051024
 Now it would be up to me to keep the little girl out of mischief .	190.63740626644
 Pat had been worried as hell ever since she 'd lost her job on that fashion magazine .	1791.9192998431347
 It had gone big with the Hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of Art and Apparel .	337.12428883070146
 How about me trying to help her get her job back ?	746.7045660756846
 All evening Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion .	441.2813841277437
 It just about blew us both out of the water when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with .	256.4879204249954
 But brother I ca n't take a job right now , she said with her eyes on her ice cream , I 'm going to have a baby , Francis Xavier 's baby , my own husband 's baby .	499.1221560779868
 My first thought was how had it happened so soon , but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we 'd been living together six weeks .	689.9495093165767
 Pat meanwhile was bubbling over with sentiment .	1012.1571610075359
 Greatest thing that ever happened .	235.12741156768666
 Now Eileen really would have to settle down to love honor and obey , and she 'd have to quit drinking .	597.5290153543931
 He 'd come East for the christening , by God he would .	189.07325267993355
 When we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into Eileen 's hand to help towards a layette .	683.5207702653686
 Before he left town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job .	341.5855884414166
 Pat had contacts all over the labor movement .	693.6670303299895
 A friend of Pat 's named Frank Sposato had just muscled into the Portwatchers ' Union .	286.35742359764004
 The portwatchers were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves .	76.83519964865796
 Most of them were elderly men .	522.4290858232323
 It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of New York .	279.03724831709155
 They were n't as well paid as they should have been .	229.01432793084447
 One reason the portwatchers let Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen .	143.5627521564008
 Sposato needed a front , some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the Redhook local .	487.9752500686843
 There I was a retired wobbly and structural iron worker who 'd never gouged a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement .	473.23282806032023
 For once radicalism was a recommendation .	111.06212985430493
 Sposato could n't wait to get me hired .	347.6632036774519
 With my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked the honest working stiff .	819.6428403110368
 The things a man will do for a woman .	180.07887668650866
 There was one fact which Rector could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny .	185.43995750530928
 As long as there were two human beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave .	391.72162210106563
 No matter how devoted a man was , no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord , he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual .	354.32492407714483
 All of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord 's servants .	134.55614424542088
 It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions .	197.96241215580827
 Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church- his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel .	219.10578160997682
 He was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego , demanding to be satisfied , for the two were intertwined and could not be separated .	187.65458157650025
 He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated , the Communists in the village rooted out , the mission standing triumphant , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant , too .	245.91475233916412
 But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan , that man 's ambition when linked with God would be a driving , indefatigable force for good in the world .	226.9553333866608
 He sighed .	295.9792717467007
 How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice .	259.1034737523187
 He would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought about , would be sweet indeed .	362.73595760160913
 His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days .	198.14212914848892
 His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print shop , using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse .	254.47391968091938
 In any event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked , telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what Kayabashi was planning .	268.2972608176614
 Hino was elated at the prospect .	33.41530395398801
 He was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor- an excellent place to make contact with the enemy .	208.70747468479794
 He left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday , nodding attentively as Rector gave him his final instructions .	157.94674557976924
 He was to get involved in no arguments ; he was to try to make no converts ; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard .	196.28296372829655
 It was a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it , for Hino , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage agent .	305.80076275238093
 If he wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection .	198.05177828358026
 In all of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino .	255.83603049182565
 From the moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job , any job- his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise hand- he had been ready to become a Christian .	248.0051990306282
 He had already been studying the Bible ; he knew the fundamentals , and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector , announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that .	202.84750890543663
 Rector had never been able to find out much about Hino 's past .	149.97061417447924
 Hino talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject .	380.4811914617312
 Putting the pieces of this mosaic together , Rector had the vague outlines of a biography .	80.60111148157195
 Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in Chiba , and divided his life between the land and the sea , supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat .	307.74184259839257
 Without exception Hino 's brothers turned to either one or both of their father 's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller .	514.7100087555414
 He had gone into the Japanese navy , had been trained as an officer , had participated in one or two battles- he never went into detail regarding his military experience- and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out of the blue , he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian .	276.7340802541649
 Rector was often curious ; often tempted to ask questions but he never did .	638.9210839931078
 If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so unasked .	121.20075770164905
 Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellished with his active imagnation .	136.07874824132153
 When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village , Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return , for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector 's office rarely rang unless it was important .	145.01692573699523
 He was surprised to find Kayabashi 's secretary on the other end of the line .	97.02459863080394
 He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted .	110.50693610175811
 The oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries , the secretary said , businessmen from Tokyo for the most part , and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission .	160.64498673167253
 They had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it .	281.5518892992437
 Oh ?	1022.2031303708311
 Rector said .	35.163325201335915
 I guess it will be all right .	282.11324100444364
 When would the oyabun like to bring his guests up here ?	243.81180507136634
 This afternoon , the secretary said .	224.2988866070214
 At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time .	341.8537933027479
 All right , Rector said .	92.2738860620745
 I will be expecting them .	203.1524412209196
 He was about to hang up the phone , but a note of hesitancy in the secretary 's voice left the conversation open .	187.11349870362582
 He had something more to say .	96.95908596767421
 I beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers , he said .	461.3927694237592
 Rector laughed despite himself .	573.4137218326294
 Unless the oyabun has been working on it , he said , then checked himself and added You can tell Kayabashi-san that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use .	309.1600937802107
 Arigato gosaimasu .	14.761614130348399
 The secretary sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in Rector 's hand .	253.14742150150755
 Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission .	223.3036077592301
 For the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it was probably the latter .	270.48572905161126
 Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village .	227.71866512551063
 At the same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity .	327.0983689977454
 No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived .	189.76224965745624
 When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds .	304.8147196740095
 Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn .	133.57537846698676
 Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .	162.44241415728277
 A good initial impression would be important now .	464.00634356852976
 He went into the print shop , where Fletcher had just finished cleaning the press .	295.845748949448
 How many pamphlets do we have in stock ?	891.7003184793352
 Rector said .	34.57374806970725
 I should say about a hundred thousand , Fletcher said .	166.2666926877197
 Why ?	533.3294824691271
 I would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon , Rector said , He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create , the picture of a very busy mission .	258.9148354809274
 He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly , just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner .	274.5440361510214
 Fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things Rector requested .	402.3198342293759
 Rector 's next stop was at the schoolroom , where Mavis was monitoring a test .	124.42237149954906
 He beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside .	287.51148394587057
 He told her of the visitors and then of his plans .	168.84924654501586
 How many children do you have present today ?	868.0397909069096
 he said .	121.83953882986778
 She looked back toward the schoolroom .	102.01263411978671
 Fifteen , she said .	246.38262764225308
 No , only fourteen .	620.5512782766496
 The little Ito girl had to go home .	185.1644980321615
 She has a pretty bad cold .	582.4486658030336
 I would like them to appear very busy today , not busy exactly , but joyous , exuberant , full of life .	320.46660312790976
 I want to create the impression of a compound full of children .	272.91552921285245
 Do you think you can manage it ?	833.0250119666099
 Mavis smiled .	166.07458903705367
 I 'll try .	369.39575636161015
 As Rector was walking back toward the residential hall , Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him .	251.56219687618895
 The altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen his spirits , but he was still a little wary around Rector for they had not yet discussed the incident .	147.62095618380877
 I think I 've fixed the pump so we wo n't have to worry about it for a long time , he said .	405.72448417108495
 I 've adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water gets too low .	876.3136081071784
 Fine , Rector said .	196.922797816442
 He looked out over the expanse of the compound .	55.90683012893765
 It was going to take a lot of activity to fill it .	132.5715314186672
 Have you ever operated a transit ?	1743.816463554313
 he said .	119.07991470248237
 No , sir , Johnson said .	372.20370777484396
 You are about to become a first-class surveyor , Rector said .	129.0669557243304
 When Konishi gets back with the jeep , I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys .	308.65437022501953
 Konishi can help you .	163.4169946635971
 You 'll find an old transit in the basement .	368.77887979261294
 The glass is out of it , but that wo n't matter .	187.72735207875047
 It looks pretty efficient and that 's the important thing .	556.3771245519883
 He went on to explain what he had in mind .	196.47291164651048
 Johnson nodded .	4333.743456311792
 He said he could do it .	74.69681171641582
 Rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall .	238.8355379362496
 It was rather a childish game , all in all , but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much .	269.730219085523
 He was not sure what effect it would have , but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it .	239.4845069948153
 He was not going to lose the mission by default , and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission , he was going to be in for a surprise .	147.74133087630855
 He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall , and then to take charge of the office while the party was here .	285.37427548664317
 When everything had been done , Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock .	364.2234883960488
 At two thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi 's party .	178.66334680811158
 Then Rector , attired in his best blue serge suit , sat in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoking a cigarette and waiting .	171.26889613048886
 The air was cooler here , and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass , an effect which he found pleasant .	236.52713052276107
 She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient .	545.5555952910346
 The fish took the bait .	110.17886214330072
 He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but- joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned .	285.86837045420623
 But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement .	202.77494198979713
 She was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed .	220.1697138007757
 Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose .	334.31524480178314
 She wrote again and now , abandoning for the moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career .	220.18702237002404
 She could act and she could write .	335.30819358154184
 His lordship was concerned in the management of Drury Lane but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and criticize her novel ?	195.71765091615902
 At last he consented to meet her , and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal Have you any objection to the following plan ?	736.2282116482986
 On Thursday evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles .	623.6794232652971
 There we shall be free and unknown ; we can return the following morning h She concluded by asking for a brief interview- to settle with you where- and she threw in a tribute to his gentle manners and the wild originality of your countenance .	499.44287484097634
 She opened his reply with trembling fingers h he agreed !	1512.5602469081239
 And he would see her that evening .	236.02844155171164
 Victory at last !	4003.1286842456666
 At their meeting he told her not to bother about where- he would attend to that .	373.50298428234385
 There was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and , as Claire rose to go , he asked her to sing him one song before she left .	156.9114055471361
 She sang him Scott 's charming ballad Rosabelle , which was the vogue of the moment .	199.92294872109667
 She had never sung better .	653.0033546937799
 Your voice is delightful , he approved with a warm smile .	649.58411965632
 Tomorrow will be a new experience- I have never before made love to a nightingale h. There have been cooing doves , chattering magpies , thieving jackdaws , a proud peacock , a silly goose , and a harpy eagle- whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals .	176.20734608978896
 And so they went , he choosing of all places an inn near Medmenham Abbey , scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the Hellfire Club .	208.9976346516856
 He regaled Claire with an account of the mock mass performed by the cassocked bloods , which he had had at firsthand from old Bud Dodington , one of the leaders of the so-called Order .	128.19969759434184
 Each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this , it seems , was not employed for self-flagellation h. Naked girls danced in the chancel of the Abbey , the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities .	265.5956959529463
 The jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish .	63.23276167485884
 Alas , all that belonged to the age of Devil Dashwood and Wicked Wilkes , abbot and beadsman of the Order !	50.581580739076095
 The casual seduction of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison .	77.92361044625154
 They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate .	150.87188045123426
 A scant half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace , the air about them scented with stock , and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden .	277.93122080465275
 Charming and peaceful- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure ?	489.16573258973875
 Alone with the fabulous Byron !	635.6428278146493
 How many women had longed for the privilege that was hers .	283.6800493556008
 How was she to behave , Claire wondered .	210.7042508859041
 To be passive , to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd .	379.9230821284217
 She was the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare 's poem .	258.81078621181325
 And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience , satiety might well be an equal handicap .	236.29220006464575
 No , she would not pretend modesty , but neither must she be crudely bold .	163.8520856017009
 Mystery- that was the thing .	53.655414207284565
 In the bedroom she would insist on darkness .	558.6192861220973
 With his club foot he might well be grateful .	713.7991314465363
 At the inn , which was situated close to a broad weir , Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference and addressed as milord .	99.69015428734302
 The place was evidently a familiar haunt and Claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown .	321.06943664616193
 The fire in the sitting room was lighted .	273.71391354355916
 What about the bedroom ?	234.60727342387395
 Byron inquired .	5073.929732198699
 Seems to me last time I was here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell .	375.37657916193547
 We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney , milord , but I promise you you 'll never have trouble of that sort again .	291.54212912851943
 So , not only had he been here before , but it seemed he might well come again .	196.5580970361789
 Claire felt suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan .	241.91793563646462
 A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port .	557.3461269918491
 When Napoleon 's ship had borne him to Elba , French wines had started to cross the Channel , the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years , but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled .	406.8871757187453
 As they waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in hand , while Byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers .	373.55711980244416
 Sex is overpriced , he said .	23.598843962544933
 The great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against Fate , not man against man for the prize of a woman 's body .	299.1996081747753
 So do n't see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance .	505.96637952146034
 The gods seemed to think sex pretty important , she rebutted .	489.02463911623084
 Mars and Venus , Bacchus and Ariadne , Jupiter and Io , Byron and the nymph of the owl 's nest .	109.26403507047934
 That would be Minerva , I suppose .	62.63252185564056
 Was n't the owl her symbol ?	495.9269767781666
 Byron laughed .	3694.741801848126
 So you know something of the classics , do you ?	286.42591136298677
 Tell me about Minerva , how she behaved , what she did to please you .	262.5986371321789
 I 'll tell you nothing .	391.5035248345433
 I do n't ask you who 't is you 're being unfaithful to , husband or lover .	418.1633333828147
 Frankly , I do n't care .	81.85808787570326
 For a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity , who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind .	398.6307222382648
 Very well , she said , I 'll not catechize you .	135.95483371834212
 What matter the others so long as I have my place in history .	411.6320502106065
 She was striking the right note .	350.5632286946821
 No man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed , with one so favored , flattery could hardly seem overdone .	290.31592171604365
 Brains and beauty , high position in both the social and intellectual worlds , athlete , fabled lover- if ever the world was any man 's oyster it was his .	273.9710076696601
 The light supper over , Claire went to him and , slipping an arm about his shoulder , sat on his knee .	275.26944801863584
 He drew her close and , hand on cheek , turned her face to his .	468.98994883873104
 Her lips , moist and parted , spoke his name .	334.1100166886147
 Byron !	7201.0414613162875
 His hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown ; then , to better purpose , he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers , untied it .	158.8788872889092
 The bodice beneath was buttoned and , withdrawing his lips from hers , he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it , unhurriedly as if she were a child .	104.24222645327757
 But , kindled by his kiss , his caressing hand , her desire was aflame .	48.61302341134815
 She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom .	494.56413392606134
 Lord Byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color .	1198.3093305184643
 He drank slowly with due appreciation .	347.25743011343377
 It was an excellent vintage .	53.2384670863646
 He rose and went to the bedroom .	123.60106012149157
 Pausing in the doorway he said The form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , is the most challenging loveliness in all nature .	206.629433381936
 When Claire returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become Byron 's mistress .	312.133971931071
 By odd coincidence , on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read Parisina , which was the latest of the titled poet 's successes .	382.8183930000111
 As he declaimed the sonorous measures , it was as much as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings .	191.86496707587747
 Although it is not the best of which he is capable , said Shelley as he closed the book , it is still poetry of a high order .	198.2916053892207
 If he would only leave the East , said Mary .	248.90657821986903
 I am tired of sultans and scimitars .	80.37997850226414
 The hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte , said Claire , with slightly overdone carelessness .	144.61130164920877
 How do you know that ?	294.9480554855442
 demanded Mary .	2428.201664222688
 I was told it on good authority , Claire answered darkly .	157.6594811601069
 I must n't tell , I must n't tell , she repeated to herself .	262.7580662253043
 I promised him I would n't .	322.44698075219713
 CHAPTER 9 WINTER CAME , and with it Mary 's baby- a boy as she had wished .	264.96305410424185
 William , he was called , in honor of the man who was at once Shelley 's pensioner and his most bitter detractor .	188.07371118484411
 With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter Fanny and Mrs Godwin will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement , and that her child is well .	454.95718150844124
 At the same time another child- this one of Shelley 's brain- was given to the world Alastor , a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind 's musings .	139.98751613067597
 Alastor was published only to be savagely attacked , contemptuously ignored .	158.70679223984266
 Shelley sent a copy to Southey , a former friend , and another to Godwin .	182.47469855418274
 Neither acknowledged the gift .	885.0512135739531
 Only Mary 's praise sustained him in his disappointment .	690.7849574046786
 She understood completely .	1033.5944326503973
 Not a thought nor a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation .	377.5346551491333
 You have made the labor worth while , he said to her , smiling .	262.68740194414676
 And in the future , since I write for a public of one , I can save the poor publishers from wasting their money .	195.3339800148191
 A public of one , Mary echoed reprovingly .	82.31072085821059
 how can you say such a thing ?	632.7703521778976
 There will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of Alastor .	55.23580577770581
 There are some even now .	175.65613392103973
 What about that dear , clever Mr Thynne ?	578.8341681234598
 I am sure he is in raptures .	141.49683813282002
 Poor Mr Thynne , he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement .	197.68670334963014
 There are other Mr Thynnes .	113.12444063143623
 Not everyone is bewitched by Byron 's caliphs and harem beauties .	108.09541346332841
 Mary 's supercritical attitude toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute .	320.90008000231626
 She was resentful of his easy success as compared with Shelley 's failure .	295.24376831014183
 The same month that Alastor was published , Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The Siege of Corinth , a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley 's generosity rebelled at .	338.12363997298144
 The lordly poet was at low-water mark .	97.17012244587113
 The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent .	1009.6847649340434
 On all sides doors were being slammed in his face .	316.1565912561501
 The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity .	204.82592313172438
 Now , under the impact of his wife 's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be .	139.6246623278527
 He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin .	444.5493199682861
 For the moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity .	152.65916987712288
 But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing .	281.7400862805832
 Byron , since the separation from his wife had been living in a smallish house in Piccadilly Terrace .	147.18288870294643
 He refused to bring Claire to it even as an occasional visitor , claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes .	209.0808811386038
 Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel .	230.59293023633205
 He had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order , but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonel 's belt .	275.8683835520327
 Despite his yearning , the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines .	239.88461397257592
 He would remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task .	324.96851347692325
 -Beckworth .	27.827324830045214
 -Sir ?	61.17295935415614
 -Fetch me the copies of everything B and C companies have requisitioned in the last six months .	337.1952148808617
 -The last six months , sir ?	917.1393636258466
 -You heard me .	106.13216927557347
 There 's a lot of waste going on here .	291.73557223263435
 It 's got to stop .	196.00524585202055
 I want to take a look .	153.97709002960755
 This is no damned holiday , Beckworth .	80.01913334361433
 Get busy .	5932.856765427354
 -Yes , sir .	141.74436913091375
 Beckworth left the tent .	134.75509814249818
 Below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank .	176.57699613460574
 He glanced back .	300.7753663549664
 The colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs , methodically tearing at his thumbnail .	147.8738313774501
 9 THE BOMBPROOF was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth .	223.95998995883954
 It stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank .	261.53656165610926
 From the outside , it seemed no more than a low drumlin , a lump on the dark earth .	124.75428772599061
 A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor .	600.9591425497539
 Two slits enabled observers to watch across the river .	664.3113657283255
 The place smelled strongly of rank , fertile earth , rotting wood and urine .	170.49863614142131
 The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson 's boots .	366.6161508991033
 At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle .	423.2606447567072
 There was no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back , stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams .	290.1635859078675
 In the corner was the soldier with the white flag .	175.57174179089384
 He stood stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth .	215.6533796288689
 Watson hardly looked at him .	729.2995664499739
 The man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant , brandishing the flag of truce .	163.95144917530786
 Someone had hauled him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed .	365.26249284397556
 An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank .	245.08587089788162
 The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy .	403.467601895895
 When the boat had touched , the weaker ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers .	311.2255531599266
 Watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof .	106.8578191283607
 The officer had told him that both lists must be checked .	315.3629584610989
 Watson had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass .	212.57980928068173
 The officer , surprised , said he would have to see .	162.77859995324803
 Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later .	643.6008936754395
 He had peered through the darkness at the rampart .	37.154484470713335
 The men he would take back across the river stood there , but he turned away from them .	234.6653247302065
 He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt .	191.4290090253642
 He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him .	80.46635262720183
 Though Watson carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence .	423.414301595467
 Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence could not exorcise his form .	151.6687595056292
 Watson glanced briefly at him , seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner .	1236.787443288193
 -We wo n't be too long .	232.02795299199624
 If my pass is approved , I may be a half hour .	281.45155494166056
 The soldier answered in a curious , muffled voice , his lips barely moving .	994.2545174488629
 Watson turned away and did not see the man 's knees buckle and his body sag .	227.0533628828093
 -Yes , sir .	141.4663685510274
 He had acknowledged the man .	99.13107620125555
 It was easier to think now , Watson decided .	267.19166338668583
 The stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts .	644.0700465443117
 He paced slowly , stooping , staring at the damp , slippery floor .	124.83959135850112
 He tried to order the words of the three Union officers , seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy .	246.6607888619896
 But he groped blindly .	142.0512355641903
 His lack of success steadily eroded his interest .	361.14331877262504
 He stopped pacing , leaned against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift .	203.88952151102131
 A feeling of futility , an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known , seeped through him .	275.7369342850114
 What in the name of God was he doing , crouched in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river ?	201.2594134562107
 Why had he crossed the dark water , to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole ?	210.8522089165539
 He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion .	215.22703374234356
 He was conscious of a growing sense of absurdity .	212.70379292411945
 Hillman had written it all out , had n't he ?	132.4570999579736
 Was n't the report official enough ?	1393.3343968533495
 What did he hope to accomplish here ?	331.37143849061937
 Hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank .	238.76703941117404
 Prompted by a guilty urge , he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected .	143.18000983665758
 For what ?	258.9855335425803
 To tell John something he would find out for himself .	377.9045264395919
 The figure in the corner belched loudly , a deep , liquid eruption .	173.0596697663884
 Watson snorted and then laughed aloud .	1542.9268629583294
 Exactly !	67.88647443157564
 The soldier 's voice was muffled again , stricken with chagrin .	180.9074651438836
 He clutched the staff , and his dark eyes blinked apologetically .	155.28486510900566
 -'Scuse me , sir .	203.46176152202372
 -Let 's get out of here .	144.9382963429548
 Watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river weeds .	283.09693050305015
 To his left , the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank .	128.75887192381725
 The flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current .	199.442708032236
 A soldier held the end of a frayed rope .	190.28822645923555
 Three Union guards appeared , carrying their rifles at ready .	2036.2974785717738
 Watson stared at them curiously .	439.44207176712956
 They were stocky men , well fed and clean-shaven , with neat uniforms and sturdy boots .	468.1030734332312
 Behind them shambled a long column of weak , tattered men .	263.7144431249364
 The thin gray figures raised a hoarse , cawing cry like the call of a bird flock .	466.99042362339657
 They moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness , elbowing and shoving .	38.2218587575485
 Four men were knocked down , but did not attempt to rise .	341.97904314852974
 They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats .	225.34898242899766
 The Union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy , indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs .	281.6624195908552
 The crawling men tried to rise and fell again .	206.00340094079934
 No one moved to them .	148.39851331804118
 Watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg shrilly .	698.5926994085429
 In a confused , soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms , the two men were dragged into the same skiff .	135.30674919132915
 The third crawling man forced himself erect .	516.7134545482678
 He swayed like a drunkard , his arms milling in slow circles .	183.62328628215275
 He paced forward unsteadily , leaning too far back , his head tilted oddly .	174.33136084108378
 His steps were short and stiff , and , with his head thrown back , his progress was a supercilious strut .	168.37114230906266
 He appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom .	164.27463528751787
 He stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge , his weight nearly swamping the craft .	113.70232330535202
 Watson looked for the fourth man .	312.4091240715806
 He had reached the three passive guards ; he crept in an incertain manner , patting the ground before him .	161.0426446956478
 The guards did not look at him .	186.26471515808214
 The figure on the earth halted , seemingly bewildered .	283.7828406147007
 He sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound .	203.0124562601677
 Then he began to crawl again .	71.99163980939542
 Watson watched the creeping figure .	1715.0438525770473
 He felt a spectator interest .	205.39039619471384
 Would the man make it or not ?	397.7155986852028
 If only there was a clock for him to crawl against .	182.3473686270599
 If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes , say , then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud .	145.78670864536647
 Say three minutes to make it sporting .	1289.7443883791564
 Still the guards did not move , but stood inert , aloof from the slow-scrambling man .	104.11020171971435
 The figure halted , and Watson gasped .	218.61078156591964
 The man began to creep in the wrong direction , deceived by a slight rise in the ground !	340.32790233805275
 He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart .	131.99486087558185
 Watson raced for him , his boots slamming the soft earth .	635.9453404976078
 The guards came to life with astonishing menace .	743.0163072903669
 They spun and flung their rifles up .	406.95387174414793
 Watson gesticulated wildly .	1493.0079969217923
 One man dropped to his knee for better aim .	588.4107583885509
 -Let me help him , for the love of God !	169.7497748860567
 The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with sullen , puzzled faces .	625.6111404257342
 Watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped , panting heavily .	130.91721847271415
 He reached down and closed his fingers on the man 's upper arm .	287.98698539776785
 Beneath his clutch , a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone .	128.90057621585163
 Watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet .	466.1262489540121
 Watson stared into a cadaverous face .	335.38080513014006
 Two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids .	461.0239362471931
 Light sticks of fingers , the tips gummy with dark earth , patted at Watson 's throat .	850.6889497278333
 The man 's voice was a sweet , patient whisper .	151.6960091311682
 -Henry said that he 'd take my arm and get me right there .	345.3554572805705
 But you ai n't Henry .	777.8737842013899
 -No .	28.530544886733374
 -It do n't matter .	173.0683157157629
 Is it far ?	480.2141741652906
 How far could it be , Watson thought bleakly , how far can a blind man crawl ?	336.69512000162746
 Another body length or all the rest of his nighted life ?	245.19018243269701
 -Not far .	95.01661014649196
 -You talk deep .	533.0094975839952
 Not like us fellas .	141.28316604027063
 It raises the voice , bein in camp .	191.83807408511038
 You Secesh ?	124.89729790633042
 -Yes .	27.69986685812737
 Come on , now .	666.0343025372999
 Can you walk ?	1774.1853000614608
 -Why , course I can .	151.4892468880404
 I can walk real good .	829.3429445197232
 Watson stumbled down the bank .	1022.2657439003232
 The man leaned his frail body against Watson 's shoulder .	525.2738660973521
 He was no heavier than a child .	119.50603791108719
 Watson paused for breath .	3930.366358217388
 The man wheezed weakly , his fetid breath beating softly against Watson 's neck .	434.2397507158985
 His sweet whisper came after great effort .	400.5727435483635
 -Oh , Christ h. I wish you was Henry h. He promised to take me .	803.7320749553257
 -Hush .	27.81798788659407
 We 're almost there .	354.9186240358588
 Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff .	160.71016458752732
 The man swayed on a thwart , turning his ruined eyes from side to side .	210.7550447113569
 Watson turned away , sickened for the first time in many months .	174.49171121222506
 He heard the patient voice calling .	388.3580209863973
 -Henry ?	60.76377238573103
 Where are you , Henry ?	426.7282515801056
 -Make him lie down !	355.4697230070732
 Watson snatched a deep breath .	903.9093193343367
 He had not meant to shout .	43.53129536674819
 He stood with his back to the skiff .	44.48385735034899
 The men mewed and scratched , begging to be taken away .	89.59055132415634
 Watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches .	147.85917142903
 -Goddamn you !	147.97598301829734
 What do you do to them ?	201.64577433680984
 Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly .	29.726763351428165
 He was angry , sickened .	53.90569115181972
 He had not felt that during the afternoon .	95.13650417710188
 No , nor later .	393.62571135235254
 All his emotions had been inward , self-conscious .	193.32389444750194
 In war , on a night like this , it was only the outward emotions that mattered , what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others .	179.9620295046664
 Yes .	950.8965609494729
 That was it .	28.779048139629463
 He was sure of it .	58.10956133979615
 John 's type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen .	556.248513168901
 What a fool he had been to think of his brother !	268.7295326959961
 So Charles was dead .	515.6193605925733
 What did it matter ?	339.6044654269803
 His name had been crossed off a list .	237.85922107369024
 Already his cool body lay in the ground .	588.0092810820137
 What words had any meaning ?	360.48270040018133
 What had he thought of , to go to John , grovel and beg understanding ?	283.95416944711894
 To confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu , gouging at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade him rise and go ?	378.9120285137129
 Men were slaughtered every day , tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute .	495.71841954050586
 What made him think John had a right to witness his brother 's humiliation ?	362.61601408931506
 What right had John to any special consideration ?	548.1245817533534
 Was John better , more deserving ?	582.7696798867773
 To hell with John .	661.9266122323829
 Let him chafe with impatience to see Charles , rip open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in Hillman 's beautiful , schoolmaster 's hand .	328.6545309500021
 John would curse .	1586.992734626777
 He believed that brave boys did n't cry .	983.7089642711094
 Watson spat on the ground .	151.5310161356836
 He was grimly satisfied .	58.34021448512795
 He had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother 's pain .	277.30515064812494
 Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering .	367.94727385025817
 I WOULD not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming , O Gogol , O Chekhov , O Thackeray and Dickens , what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris ducks , a birdbath , and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps ?	202.91080272954727
 As I say , I would n't want to begin a day like this , but I often wonder what the dead would have done .	255.76074075504536
 But the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge .	116.96688109310374
 I can see it from this window where I write .	271.6187006719685
 It was built by the Pasterns , and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property .	114.43626842446052
 It bulks under a veil of thin , new grass , like some embarrassing fact of physicalness , and I think Mrs Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning .	213.40232787362862
 It would have been like her .	120.55280020084098
 She was a pale woman .	264.91518852374423
 Sitting on her terrace , sitting in her parlor , sitting anywhere , she ground an axe of self-esteem .	323.1281279655217
 Offer her a cup of tea and she would say , Why , these cups look just like a set I gave to the Salvation Army last year .	563.7068782175384
 Show her the new swimming pool and she would say , slapping her ankle , I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes .	454.29248673980425
 Hand her a chair and she would say , Why , it 's a nice imitation of those Queen Anne chairs I inherited from Grandmother Delancy .	732.2783531443112
 These trumps were more touching than they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights were long , her children ungrateful , and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare .	215.7521412869863
 Twenty years ago , she would have been known as a golf widow , and the sum of her manner was perhaps one of bereavement .	268.6643789623684
 She usually wore weeds , and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that Mr Pastern was dead , but Mr Pastern was far from dead .	275.35088269226657
 He was marching up and down the locker room of the Grassy Brae Golf Club shouting , Bomb Cuba !	225.35002200614355
 Bomb Berlin !	547.6311496226715
 Let 's throw a little nuclear hardware at them and show them who 's boss .	708.1906123825663
 He was brigadier of the club 's locker-room light infantry , and at one time or another declared war on Russia , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , and China .	290.9251216834377
 It all began on an autumn afternoon- and who , after all these centuries , can describe the fineness of an autumn day ?	303.2464920477083
 One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it .	179.6365810911001
 The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year 's lights .	238.50558577242273
 Leaves were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled , for all its ammoniac acidity , of beginnings .	143.83525985245473
 The boundless blue air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum .	208.20648957513222
 Leaving her house one late afternoon , Mrs Pastern stopped to admire the October light .	607.2514993548135
 It was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis .	61.289924910592575
 Mrs Pastern had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of receipts .	338.73507019429707
 It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks .	464.09372554749086
 Her house stood on a rise of ground , and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below .	409.5019854566749
 Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity .	540.8334087180857
 Mrs Balcolm worked for the brain .	238.8546184534415
 Mrs Ten Eyke did mental health .	1503.6484284895623
 Mrs Trenchard worked for the blind .	242.73762864995962
 Mrs Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat .	360.87660334268134
 Mrs Trempler was tuberculosis , Mrs Surcliffe was Mothers ' March of Dimes , Mrs Craven was cancer , and Mrs Gilkson did the kidney .	184.88006786332573
 Mrs Hewlitt led the birthcontrol league , Mrs Ryerson was arthritis , and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton 's house , a roof that signified gout .	142.68342759084067
 Mrs Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer .	415.6758305915754
 It was her destiny ; it was her life .	140.8737088198432
 Her mother had done it before her , and even her old grandmother , who had collected money for smallpox and unwed mothers .	456.37422344575293
 Mrs Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance , and most of them were ready for her .	388.4178782968596
 She experienced none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias .	337.07656154385944
 Here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry .	289.8584426783636
 The contributions were ahead of what she had got the previous year , and while the money , of course , was not hers , it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks .	238.85886736133418
 She stopped at the Surcliffes ' after dusk , and had a Scotch-and-soda .	51.340698472654566
 She stayed too late , and when she left , it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband .	429.2906172674443
 I got a hundred and sixty dollars for the hepatitis fund , she said excitedly when he walked in .	252.66455302516047
 I did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans .	92.95450292598228
 I want to get my kit in tomorrow morning- would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner ?	533.4561559566823
 But I do n't know the Flannagans , Charlie Pastern said .	93.70984053320072
 Nobody does , but they gave me ten last year .	752.2997822025478
 He was tired , he had his business worries , and the sight of his wife arranging pork chops in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day .	166.95572692088007
 He was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the Blevins ' , thinking that they might give him a drink .	250.62763090574714
 But the Blevins were away ; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door .	313.15972685767116
 Turning in at the Flannagans ' driveway , he tried to remember if he had ever met them .	249.4543327150044
 The name encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the Irish .	280.55111028141164
 There was a glass pane in the front door , and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arranging flowers .	203.72019737031803
 Infectious hepatitis , he shouted heartily .	180.3559975229175
 She took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and , walking with very small steps , started toward the door .	400.6912685551751
 Oh , please come in , she said .	354.4991947011985
 The girlish voice was nearly a whisper .	62.0552409638742
 She was not a girl , he could see .	78.19983078419854
 Her hair was dyed , and her bloom was fading , and she must have been crowding forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight .	160.55429992219177
 Your wife just called , she said , separating one word from another , exactly like a child .	478.5013258584302
 And I am not sure that I have any cash- any money , that is- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook .	411.1826209500879
 Wo n't you step into the living room , where it 's cozier ?	146.07192303875598
 A fire had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been set out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts was instantaneous .	223.11041820749713
 Where was Mr Flannagan , he wondered .	119.9028940115985
 Travelling home on a late train ?	334.6618936082549
 Changing his clothes upstairs ?	931.4830125275686
 Taking a shower ?	2713.85898898451
 At the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers , and she began to riffle these , making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation .	83.80007706774524
 I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting , she said , but wo n't you make yourself a little drink while you wait ?	1080.7013922919919
 Everything 's on the table .	178.9525224536238
 What train does Mr Flannagan come out on ?	693.6172471358029
 Mr Flannagan is away , she said .	103.98132140552869
 Her voice dropped .	1681.0389517661526
 Mr Flannagan has been away for six weeks h .	350.7123754185828
 I 'll have a drink , then , if you 'll have one with me .	168.16009075425956
 If you will promise to make it weak .	379.9866031090548
 Sit down , he said , and enjoy your drink and look for your checkbook later .	183.68162895742344
 The only way to find things is to relax .	271.3938992034146
 All in all , they had six drinks .	212.33079459887404
 She described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly .	363.41903686941714
 Mr Flannagan manufactured plastic tongue depressors .	1165.832328269175
 He travelled all over the world .	52.745985097243384
 She did n't like to travel .	278.67624791159676
 Planes made her feel faint , and in Tokyo , where she had gone that summer , she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home .	537.8401293432076
 She and her husband had formerly lived in New York , where she had many friends , but Mr Flannagan thought the country would be safer in case of war .	281.21119849582203
 She would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom .	1093.4305466171402
 She had no children ; she had made no friends .	204.3795367327808
 I 've seen you , though , before , she said with enormous coyness , patting his knee .	203.3025101708494
 I 've seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the convertible h .	1149.3987943745976
 The thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him , although he was even more touched by her plumpness .	368.6165527441526
 Sheer plumpness , he knew , is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions .	77.90256048639823
 It serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass .	397.85710140562435
 And knowing its humble place in the scale of things , why did he , at this time of life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness ?	303.23814626074983
 The remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he did n't know what to make of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook there .	336.73297048091393
 I 've never done this before , she said later , when he was arranging himself to leave .	353.2647823124879
 Her voice shook with feeling , and he thought it lovely .	556.7309901936027
 He did n't doubt her truthfulness , although he had heard the words a hundred times .	173.90136644197202
 I 've never done this before , they always said , shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders .	743.661117440406
 I 've never done this before , they always said , waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor .	397.22738063058006
 I 've never done this before , they always said , pouring another whiskey .	701.203184535562
 I 've never done this before , they always said , putting on their stockings .	270.15979445393293
 On ships at sea , on railroad trains , in summer hotels with mountain views , they always said , I 've never done this before .	859.9054287693516
 Where have you been ?	404.1983112981103
 Mrs Pastern asked sadly , when he came in .	320.69415519968857
 It 's after eleven .	284.27323652411667
 I had a drink with the Flannagans .	53.490978647812625
 She told me he was in Germany .	276.0113032494806
 He came home unexpectedly .	538.4575028623458
 Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the TV room to hear the news .	565.8129511534688
 Bomb them !	125.19125297376826
 he shouted .	839.0533436758947
 Throw a little nuclear hardware at them !	549.7124105859317
 Show them who 's boss !	1747.7886420608995
 But in bed he had trouble sleeping .	606.7707784111603
 He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college .	275.85814280095155
 He loved them .	151.2708027820139
 It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known .	88.76296955371228
 Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his handicap , his irons , his stance , his opponents , and his weather in detail , but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries .	335.3328433507722
 His money was tied up in a Nassau hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been running against him .	342.98475019692876
 His worries harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window .	180.62630978652788
 In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves .	184.83192845497138
 During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga .	198.12367508373794
 Maple and ash , beech and elm , one hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one hundred to win on Two in the eighth .	267.3163051791328
 Children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage .	508.0617047991659
 Then , getting back into bed , he thought unashamedly of Mrs Flannagan , planning where they would next meet and what they would do .	260.5187805773544
 There are , he thought , so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seemed , as it did , a little crude ?	246.43149532049907
 It was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years , not since their last journey eastward to witness their Uncle Izaak being lowered into the rocky soil ; that aside from due notification of certain major events in their lives two marriages , two births , one divorce , Christmas and Easter cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the widowed years .	398.23511165579436
 Her thoughts were not discrete .	837.8877598870206
 But there was a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons .	173.2931324885923
 She grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright , like a bird alert for flight .	955.6605867873143
 She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty-legged escritoire , warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray .	250.22536249073974
 There she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters , one to Abel , one to Mark .	252.9749991010221
 Once her trembling hand , with the pen grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper the words came sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips .	565.218965489676
 And the stiffly regal look of them , she saw grimly , lacked the quaver of age which , thwarting the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string .	216.30079972794846
 Please come down as soon as you conveniently can , the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen , I have an important matter to discuss with you .	228.97611908918904
 To Abel I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here .	276.54234815726704
 I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters .	582.6292071535257
 You may stay as long as you wish , of course , but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account , I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in .	343.57558626200637
 To Mark Please give my regards to Myra .	419.63161597599765
 She signed the letters quickly , stamped them , and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town .	360.5705965822495
 Then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water .	121.19602650104035
 My nephews will be coming down , she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining room , the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray .	288.79776575542775
 She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years ; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had faded to a near-absence of color which had , possibly from her constant looking at the water , something of the light of the sea in them .	170.9802691073777
 Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth .	197.53383016579636
 She smiled , and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face .	199.41444763062066
 That will be so nice for you , Mrs Packard , she said .	322.15191672338364
 Her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in Sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose .	590.730040945693
 Um , said the old lady , and brought her eyes down to the tray .	151.92358628869047
 You remember them , I suppose ?	333.8827142303927
 She glinted suspiciously at the dish before her Blowfish .	85.0941002144501
 I hope Raphael bought them whole .	795.6683504083592
 Angelina stepped back , her eyes roaming the tray for omissions .	202.05257958744266
 Then she looked at the old woman again , her eyes calm .	330.258111382134
 Yes , she said , I remember that they came here every summer .	282.1192680453654
 I used to play with the older one sometimes , when he 'd let me .	257.7997407126662
 Abel ?	60.957818645433825
 The name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips .	379.6136298930112
 For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile .	1104.0462334134356
 She would have said triumph .	385.7209190931683
 Then Angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen .	521.7372759705025
 Jessica Packard lifted her head and followed the retreating figure , her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips .	449.54093922550175
 For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; then she snorted and groped for her fork .	208.50596976191952
 There 's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling away of a family .	346.5524047088866
 Procreation , expansion , proliferation- these are the laws of living things , with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments oblivion .	135.5006236714073
 When the fate of the individual is visited on the group , then the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted .	357.5200831706396
 And indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth .	488.73472434435524
 She was the last living of the older generation .	121.21401863065438
 What had once been a widespread family- at one time , she knew , there were enough Packards to populate an entire county- had now narrowed down to the two boys , Abel and Mark .	216.5415353974961
 She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans .	488.2683270967405
 What hope lay in the nephews , she asked the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sired two girl children , with none to bear on the Packard name ?	259.68865580732205
 She ate .	748.8166918728124
 It seemed to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table 's empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows .	396.5263999194299
 Here , too , she talked low , quirking her head at one or another of the places , most often at Izaak 's armchair which faced her across the long table .	251.18885172255239
 Or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed , consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years .	317.2738977231188
 She thought again of her children , those two who had died young , before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies .	494.56975423327276
 The girl , her first , she barely remembered .	316.5887920843279
 It could have been anyone 's infant , for it had not survived the bassinet .	142.4073605667823
 But the boy h the boy had been alive yesterday .	292.4710507631129
 Each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her .	477.99653807834517
 He ran on his plump sticks of legs , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire .	300.33226700903197
 In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her .	414.955014808477
 It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea .	278.4934572794519
 The brothers drove down together in Mark 's small red sports car , Mark at the wheel .	863.1826884420677
 They rarely spoke .	509.16592585003633
 Abel sat and regarded the farm country which , spreading out from both sides of the road , rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields .	224.77746897893994
 He saw the land with a stranger 's eyes , all the old familiarness gone .	127.94326563066662
 And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself .	177.0055693722399
 There was stability there , too- a color which his life had had once .	376.92866317979275
 That is what childhood is , he told himself .	201.25065470418346
 Solid , settled h lost .	1061.7095413102818
 In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt Jessica 's letter .	651.0994013990227
 What bad grace , what incredible selfishness he and Mark had shown .	461.0708289043115
 The boyhood summers preceding their uncle 's funeral might never have been .	727.1499276690727
 They had closed over , absolutely , with the sealing of old Izaak 's grave .	131.68207241227216
 The small car flew on relentlessly .	252.20565961052807
 The old woman , stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took on an ominous reality .	348.0475162955331
 Abel moved and adjusted his long legs .	514.673428480136
 I suppose it has to do with the property , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters .	177.8999615627488
 Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness .	191.5914892224037
 He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer .	403.2466331518519
 Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother .	198.5053965329179
 Mark held the wheel loosely , but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he 'd make in the years to come .	403.38358561708606
 His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away .	172.02941896718517
 Mark easily looked years older than himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized .	694.0437646430163
 The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea .	727.3882467851403
 She did n't mention bringing Myra , Mark said , maneuvering the car into the next lane .	314.8651260286495
 She 's probably getting old- crotchety , I mean- and we figured uh-uh , better not .	180.8404755169121
 They 've never met , you know .	356.12381475392755
 But Myra would n't budge without an express invitation .	254.0614944137166
 I feel kind of bad about it .	345.78964479865
 He gave Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel , hugging it to him , and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt .	201.47653003812604
 I imagine the old girl has n't missed us much , Mark added , his eyes on the road .	409.5194227253284
 Abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation .	442.7089129250056
 He smiled .	150.40249241485645
 It was barely possible that his brother was right .	247.5378285384034
 He could tell they were approaching the sea .	293.54990632465865
 The air took on a special strength now that they 'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind .	254.97582666395851
 There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt water , clams , seaweed and northern air .	197.40582026562555
 He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended .	270.68076313865714
 Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant .	267.09145375592726
 Remember the Starbird ?	300.5881233913856
 Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down .	264.65041386274703
 The Starbird , Abel said .	19.182386225622697
 There was the day Uncle Izaak had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy wished .	440.6649979999666
 The two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team h all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could .	537.3592708235635
 They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually .	170.76628509487932
 He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky .	402.75299132811966
 Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her sails .	147.2491777726737
 The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay .	67.39119607492957
 They came unexpectedly upon the sea .	410.35651528699117
 Meeting it without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them .	865.5618604722766
 They were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness , became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended .	586.3639497043878
 Mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water , which , there being no moon out , at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars .	367.99030262691804
 His eyes were old and they never saw well , but heated with whisky they 'd glare at my noise , growing red and raising up his rage .	715.1435292455964
 I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I could n't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling .	491.07583164896795
 Oh he 'd not care about the Pedersen kid .	302.6301541979404
 He 'd not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain .	302.86475548647985
 That would make him mad enough if he was sober .	348.33276847656
 I did n't hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen .	232.2685456284842
 He was all shoveled up like I thought he 'd be .	136.80782365966627
 I pushed at his shoulder , calling his name .	274.0652034685096
 I think his name stopped the snoring but he did n't move except to roll a little when I shoved him .	290.8814035654998
 The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head , fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall- there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster- and I thought , Well you do n't look much like a pig-drunk bully now .	175.76213726850654
 I could n't be sure he was still asleep .	299.0287317040333
 He was a cagey sonofabitch .	10.134381592969865
 I shook him a little harder and made some noise .	411.85260372173843
 Pap-pap-pap-hey , I said .	28.617118470506785
 I was leaning too far over .	173.80647240335435
 I knew better .	243.15355602543332
 He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him .	331.0398239633885
 Oh he was smart .	360.4894057243011
 It put you off .	209.17718194792147
 I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough .	246.65602783840927
 When his arm came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck , watering my eyes , and I backed off to cough .	158.25205874876505
 Pa was on his side , looking at me , his eyes winking , the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow .	173.2479882255764
 Get the hell out of here .	565.0644489174952
 I did n't say anything , trying to get my throat clear , but I watched him .	279.4642598420284
 He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear .	228.93749396566233
 It was better , though , he 'd hit me .	181.71800522048983
 He was bitter when he missed .	248.62832643448348
 Get the hell out of here .	556.0293443592839
 Big Hans sent me .	3122.578512543342
 He told me to wake you .	257.92578001111775
 A fat hell on Big Hans .	2443.9867132814993
 Get out of here .	670.8189619835142
 He found the Pedersen kid by the crib .	52.19849131412963
 Get the hell out .	670.3234464976046
 Pa pulled at the covers .	863.2064492197818
 He was tasting his mouth .	50.16132819950365
 The kid 's froze good .	165.50330794090817
 Hans is rubbing him with snow .	884.2727566775661
 He 's got him in the kitchen .	91.40702830201744
 Pedersen ?	61.39377515244447
 No , Pa .	601.1171939761323
 It 's the Pedersen kid .	96.72725923184532
 The kid .	250.6845983272085
 Nothing to steal from the crib .	42.31524720648122
 Not stealing , Pa .	1712.7318026037485
 He was just lying there .	152.62492410031442
 Hans found him froze .	277.601038975604
 That 's where he was when Hans found him .	321.6998863666676
 Pa laughed .	4296.234852712357
 I ai n't hid nothing in the crib .	87.40823418330018
 You do n't understand , Pa .	481.32894934566065
 The Pedersen kid .	104.9155392686459
 The kid- I god damn well understand .	1270.9566190563767
 Pa had his head up , glaring , his teeth gnawing at the place where he 'd grown a mustache once .	370.37307736242917
 I god damn well understand .	3531.8257450656715
 You know I do n't want to see Pedersen .	188.16430475823063
 That cock .	29.68984570191534
 Why should I ?	441.65205053793767
 What did he come for , hey ?	161.2571694485928
 God dammit , get .	145.26429109418217
 And do n't come back .	169.85938954115244
 Find out something .	131.92902823845182
 You 're a fool .	551.3287431929677
 Both you and Hans .	429.1460583138879
 Pedersen .	28.248014495776275
 That cock .	30.90469097395667
 Do n't come back .	325.4498188656149
 Out .	651.1695437440802
 Out .	655.8151525685374
 He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow .	295.6507968304686
 He had long black hairs on his wrist .	182.4678261123624
 They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt .	23.850955536343147
 Big Hans made me come .	2288.362182079912
 Big Hans said- A fat hell on Big Hans .	4204.536941106934
 He 's an even bigger fool than you are .	780.9410723276022
 Fat , hey ?	26.014884836797368
 I taught him , dammit , and I 'll teach you .	137.05209486318236
 Out .	650.8758500787916
 You want me to drop my pot ?	1097.9420066937587
 He was about to get up so I got out , slamming the door .	116.74208448500356
 He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep .	205.335607802788
 Then he threw things .	317.0347738273062
 Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister .	190.5265421234102
 Pa 'd been shit-sick in that pot .	618.143675736042
 Hans got an axe .	378.8897902344355
 He did n't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa 's door down before he stopped .	369.9275859790447
 He might not have gone that far if Pa had n't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house .	558.3623683147254
 That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it .	1205.830611441084
 I always felt the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out .	193.09249779524686
 I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs .	452.9974150289765
 Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid 's chest and stomach .	1033.164291042626
 He was rubbing snow on the kid 's legs and feet .	403.91376461137907
 Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was turning pasty , sticking to the kid 's back and behind .	259.1764954392175
 Ai n't he going to wake up ?	320.61765840763894
 What about your pa ?	185.3582432977878
 He was awake when I left .	204.19123439123473
 What 'd he say ?	449.22477991977576
 Did you get the whisky ?	1315.1361665189781
 He said a fat hell on Big Hans .	1028.0594927338138
 Do n't be smart .	368.7936882825786
 Did you ask him about the whisky ?	790.7184476079591
 Yeah .	27.962727348521984
 Well ?	659.642951812082
 He said a fat hell on Big Hans .	1016.8027018955034
 Do n't be smart .	368.79937937121065
 What 's he going to do ?	268.77920465230875
 Go back to sleep most likely .	1115.8197701639758
 You 'd best get that whisky .	1229.2276326598128
 You go .	243.78226267815012
 Take the axe .	92.45645951887445
 Pa 's scared to hell of axes .	2788.2476947891164
 Listen to me , Jorge , I 've had enough to your sassing .	135.06222448845554
 This kid 's froze bad .	275.53911931308033
 If I do n't get some whisky down him he might die .	420.6986822100438
 You want the kid to die ?	815.3725778837934
 Do you ?	538.6831493744651
 Well , get your pa and get that whisky .	253.54582644932088
 Pa do n't care about the kid .	712.976772875733
 Jorge .	28.085106035037246
 Well he do n't .	257.57968723883124
 He do n't care at all , and I do n't care to get my head busted neither .	218.6211469797383
 He do n't care , and I do n't care to have his shit flung on me .	93.30291749025336
 He do n't care about anybody .	337.35411625975524
 All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face .	624.0064825648826
 Get pig-drunk- that 's what he wants .	491.439620445927
 He do n't care about nothing else at all .	277.8213171980609
 Nothing .	493.6810454136049
 Not Pedersen 's kid neither .	604.9745620517145
 That cock .	29.991350119933575
 Not the kid neither .	896.2252025323803
 I 'll get the spirits , Ma said .	128.02381883370742
 I 'd wound Big Hans up tight .	4246.655997087278
 I was ready to jump but when Ma said she 'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran down .	456.29121954518064
 Ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off .	238.12950045202572
 Not any more .	352.20319945654654
 Not for years .	337.46097566075383
 The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he 'd cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she saw him heaving it again , the dirty sock popping out as it flew .	369.2643934996846
 It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa 's yellow sick insides .	424.5190056647773
 No you wo n't , Big Hans said .	954.3768858601002
 Yes , Hans , if they 're needed , Ma said .	218.28936211338603
 Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her .	1161.9870434426134
 If we had , then one of us would have had to go instead .	160.8736026518756
 Hans rubbed the kid with more snow h rubbed h rubbed .	4221.503178063213
 I 'll get more snow , I said .	221.74192443804327
 I took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch .	70.33296904552775
 I do n't know where Ma went .	176.60034354628502
 I thought she 'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had .	696.5690937932806
 She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she 'd go , and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat .	593.8577574655291
 Oh , he was being queer and careful , pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm .	132.70147890436746
 He was awful angry because he 'd thought Ma was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her h I know him h I know him h we felt the same sometimes h while Ma was n't thinking about that at all , not anything like that .	421.2099937691733
 There was no way of getting even .	145.6600774095237
 It was n't like getting cheated at the fair .	114.42401539088509
 They were always trying so you got to expect it .	317.4081173144908
 Now Hans had given Ma something of his- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa- something valuable ; but since she did n't know we 'd given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back .	395.71236227235494
 Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap .	608.6965754957473
 He was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she 'd done .	343.5526706353567
 Ma had found one of Pa 's hiding places .	190.9893486283673
 She 'd found one and she had n't said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the privy and found the first one .	293.84947796889736
 Pa had a knack for hiding .	85.92887491286035
 He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it .	237.3769880883243
 But now Ma .	39.498051925725534
 She 'd found it by luck most likely but she had n't said anything and we did n't know how long ago it 'd been or how many other ones she 'd found , saying nothing .	1000.5489575187895
 Pa was sure to find out .	340.85515883085105
 Sometimes he did n't seem to because he hid them so well he could n't find them himself or because he looked and did n't find anything and figured he had n't hid one after all or had drunk it up .	343.5582672267383
 But he 'd find out about this one because we were using it .	279.4924071494902
 A fool could see what was going on .	531.8221613917405
 If he found out Ma found it- that 'd be bad .	405.58607910079314
 He took pride in his hiding .	75.46414150352899
 It was all the pride he had .	122.83987832006855
 I guess fooling Hans and me took doing .	784.171527940206
 But he did n't figure Ma for much .	132.69092830832358
 He did n't figure her at all , and if he found out h a woman h it 'd be bad .	225.83407268196908
 Hans poured some in a tumbler .	325.64028122424014
 You going to put more towels on him ?	477.1536071884699
 No .	348.3720367531728
 Why not ?	631.0867940113211
 That 's what he needs , something warm to his skin , do n't he ?	288.6721615751664
 Not where he 's froze good .	151.3532078894487
 Heat 's bad for frostbite .	362.09694948488544
 That 's why I only put towels on his chest and belly .	627.7301489884396
 He 's got to thaw slow .	492.12797110409576
 You ought to know that .	312.61285082443095
 Colors on the towels had run .	162.3007325085579
 Ma poked her toe in the kid 's clothes .	230.86126467637106
 What are we going to do with these ?	285.2977259857498
 Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid 's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin .	894.0341880093862
 Here , help me prop him up .	139.03679857038108
 I got hold his mouth open .	490.09846426976605
 I did n't want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid 's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and did n't make any move to .	348.96740025130504
 Come on , Jorge .	358.9145029973248
 All right .	276.60718304594326
 Lift , do n't shove h lift .	152.36107283931156
 OK , I 'm lifting .	227.518662519305
 I took him by the shoulders .	118.12108149435639
 His head flopped back .	119.19695614112906
 His mouth fell open .	805.2152837242659
 The skin on his neck was tight .	334.51012882507445
 He was cold all right .	191.70322640904718
 Hold his head up .	112.51190554663101
 He 'll choke .	459.86328911914967
 His mouth is open .	267.55846904508394
 His throat 's shut .	820.2696879839532
 He 'll choke .	460.74777150071
 He 'll choke anyway .	1320.0390978805694
 Hold his head up .	113.54921151532137
 I ca n't .	281.60281436073956
 Do n't hold him like that .	339.181203815598
 Put your arms around him .	801.4672609045816
 Well Jesus .	908.3670425229993
 He was cold all right .	191.47158696297575
 I put my arm carefully around him .	419.888995652784
 Hans had his fingers in the kid 's mouth .	339.8694992628747
 Now he 'll choke for sure .	615.2816607172894
 Shut up .	53.772512117804865
 Just hold him like I told you .	419.76015449127806
 He was cold all right , and wet .	207.88620128659628
 I had my arm behind his back .	235.1187484542459
 He was in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing .	105.64816891844836
 There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; it was always the same unqualified success now .	282.6802822311374
 He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values .	283.2993837184971
 Stowey Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality .	226.8568635026846
 He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rose at half-past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop .	494.82699695270315
 This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist .	684.522488026635
 The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor .	396.8463489850666
 His files , desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos .	605.1409078570063
 Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form his models , drawings , ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac .	233.0371508461078
 Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house .	234.73175994076277
 He worked standing , with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person 's hand .	399.30744738484157
 Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved .	204.05638022537266
 It all seemed- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows- as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler 's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss 's work .	174.79519151295304
 This air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine .	310.36880512731307
 But he was not bored at all ; he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it .	286.674545974822
 There are , after all , fortunate souls who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey was , as things go , a fortunate man .	270.38959903624163
 He left his home the day after New Year 's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat .	288.80832565648785
 He would wear this same costume in Florida , despite his wife Cleota 's reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him .	403.93449587116197
 But he was too busy to hear what she was saying .	242.61186005832468
 So they parted when she was in an impatient humor .	357.427072644168
 When he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon , feeling in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before , she came out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head , which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window .	231.82268595582087
 Finding the key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog , and said , Defrost the refrigerator .	231.39067676034892
 He saw the surprise in her face , and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen .	173.40904213133106
 He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him .	879.5305564475331
 He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it .	679.0591643710542
 He would settle himself into his seat to laugh .	425.3531517851736
 Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing .	353.83678499687994
 And she was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog , mad as she was at his going away when he really did n't have to , mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by .	404.88292245587024
 She was forty-nine at this time , a lanky woman of breeding with an austere , narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer .	261.7115621632438
 Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders .	827.8030242054175
 There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from money-making and which , besides , has kept its estate intact .	380.3927354037317
 She was personally sloppy , and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist , and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves .	213.43297242051523
 But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed , brushed , and taking breaths of air , and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy , a grace of history , so to speak , and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value .	305.4456044181399
 She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp .	591.5686988221154
 Now drive carefully , for God 's sake !	817.8627433659454
 she called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure .	862.6228783124725
 But he did not notice , and was already backing the car down to the road , saying Toot-toot !	185.1962102412669
 to the stump of a tree as he passed it , the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed .	175.6209590090699
 She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road .	412.2934382266023
 Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window .	124.5816506306975
 She had begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell .	407.8059097464451
 He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once .	293.2269253538378
 Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said Toot !	778.6290521744851
 once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .	271.05137901527877
 She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building .	570.0000328016342
 There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind .	135.33084527380325
 She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the realest part of life .	401.39616425210943
 Now she could let out the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors ; she could dust the plants , then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on ; improvise cha-chas on the harp ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers , reading the ads as well as the news , registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire .	305.67325273295467
 She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting to be .	341.5870882698599
 She fell asleep leaning on her hand , hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm .	254.70738342850663
 Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers .	232.96653632910318
 Then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes .	340.7174441279944
 She stood up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests .	205.59323911108413
 She went into the living room and turned on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway .	280.1069486519096
 She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself .	592.5939645534944
 They were both so young , after all , so unready for any final parting .	132.30867949942203
 How could it have been thirty years already , she wondered ?	656.3277304319463
 But yes , nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine , and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen .	274.0706570711598
 She stood still over the leg of lamb , rubbing herbs into it , quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath , a sensation of violence that started her shivering .	327.5892225619264
 But they all said , No , your time will come .	172.69414147808348
 Enjoy being a bride while you can .	520.074296750359
 There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning House where the Albright boys always took their brides , till they could get a house and a farm of their own .	220.25532274751717
 So when the Big House filled up and ran over , the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes .	437.41722333178643
 And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do .	265.72164456505413
 So Linda Kay gave up asking , and accepted her reprieve .	355.6457051435006
 Without saying so , she was really grateful ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joe 's wife .	638.0615821093425
 She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it spotless and neat , shabby as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe .	256.99108081217986
 She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this .	306.933060401026
