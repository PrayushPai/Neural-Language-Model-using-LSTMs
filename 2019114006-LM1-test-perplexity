 You mean dream ?	3809.6088474329003
 Not exactly .	605.3059375939347
 Just see it .	215.24509741861135
 Benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble .	418.5550878244508
 Nope , just you , all the time- sometimes I think it 's the only way I 'll ever get a decent partner .	494.6334971040809
 Ramey smiled but he thought to himself , I always see me too .	260.49960541211925
 Never Benny .	179.10565961024002
 Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt , Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind .	378.946865588906
 Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think .	279.60165716901423
 With this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down .	159.97531106342265
 You seen him yet ?	579.0236679458621
 Benson said , referring to the Indian .	102.30097418864752
 He was n't in the car , Ramey said .	44.665349126618125
 You did n't go clear around , Benson said .	204.5536449693716
 If you want to see something , he 's back on the other side by the trunk of the car .	82.66428017685388
 Too long a waiting line , Ramey answered , pretending to joke .	716.9979884203045
 A few minutes later the insurance man , a road checker , drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state .	232.97311294024354
 It was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed .	622.4986713843483
 Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed .	310.3033784671985
 All the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges , the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane .	873.6337912512257
 Horsely , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist .	307.2963601428861
 It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist , an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head .	293.1638011914134
 The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men 's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town .	300.92030555532335
 He chatted with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer .	75.70616805601881
 Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear .	405.9854312764006
 When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer .	170.86115863507544
 There 's a body you wo n't mind looking at , Benson said and they stopped .	419.23033957872786
 She had driven up with her husband in a convertible with Eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that .	637.3184677132923
 She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt .	345.6917339758839
 Slender and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply .	421.55081873699567
 What outfit does she drive for ?	2423.6855243116606
 Benson said .	35.465219925106446
 Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey , a recognition .	147.4657073247722
 She might have been someone he had once loved .	433.1927198340313
 He had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run .	132.51529113610533
 The truck routes , the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay .	529.280031208352
 How would you ever see her again ?	512.492265997059
 The feeling subsided , it was only a small yearning .	113.20562580627706
 Their work was lonely .	482.59149836322024
 What 's she doing in this bunch ?	555.8307494708852
 Benson said , and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been .	272.8196968026948
 The girl looked around at the countryside .	239.81483809606092
 Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing .	1462.4131449092583
 It made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on .	364.846758322743
 She began to watch a blonde-haired man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly .	226.82440498892322
 What had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but Benson knew what it was .	370.10277568816326
 The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson , in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real , said , You do n't want to go around there , Ma'am .	225.25547376818878
 The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her .	665.2299566620551
 The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car .	419.4408506370947
 The two drivers moved closer .	905.7983643810587
 What does he want , a spoon ?	280.51141808159286
 Benson said to Ramey .	27.310042176170796
 One tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain .	281.7689267628778
 With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian 's foot that he would always remember .	337.191647052195
 The laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top .	93.96736061939085
 The slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside .	281.2336478236075
 The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man .	117.46437848970105
 He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows .	255.26713416407196
 He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes .	317.8832321893328
 He was very tanned- big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster .	126.16207107417024
 He 's dead , is n't he ?	132.21886442680164
 the man said .	131.3027314508594
 He turned and bent over the body of the Indian .	138.38043275843495
 There was nothing in particular on the man 's face .	114.64595574272968
 It was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine .	206.10114488232304
 What 's this ?	390.13921826044697
 the man said , backing up a step , still looking down .	303.0870928326978
 His words were mostly to himself .	299.29595499238803
 Do n't .	405.3435648318256
 There was a gentle concern in Benson 's voice .	129.38035206284488
 Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man 's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded , blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement .	193.06638773240374
 But what is it ?	120.73183880426272
 the man said with a tone of impatience .	229.7190195503931
 But what is it ?	120.93497348705424
 The man had spoken only once .	279.26914498458603
 Ramey heard the words again inside , weakened , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears .	296.24388574944203
 The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey 's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man 's leg .	227.36649439607257
 Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin .	956.0830974949065
 He stared at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , Do n't do that , fella .	426.1531335917237
 Them 's brains .	187.16795072607397
 The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist .	405.8954213069465
 Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth .	203.68598083850551
 It was a straight , solid , once-in-a-lifetime shot ; he laid all four knuckles in between the man 's cheekbone and his chin .	255.03920698211772
 Ramey 's fist and the air expelled from the man 's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together .	263.7927900662723
 The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement .	510.93892158309944
 Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand .	286.3739932837608
 As he watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet .	488.2313859630256
 He had n't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard .	385.04111261428824
 With a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him .	194.7859235642445
 His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open .	298.3123042838933
 After what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it .	795.4078161267001
 The man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth .	373.4809391791706
 He moaned and pulled the hand away .	124.51626451031576
 Even yet there was no realization in his eyes .	219.00682694578012
 Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him .	469.18555122526675
 He did not look around .	111.61097236379526
 What happened ?	482.3100506811767
 someone said .	491.4143730521734
 He 's hurt !	342.11759349519195
 A woman 's voice said , and then he heard a sort of wail from the man 's wife .	113.88120417908193
 The man on the ground began to move ; one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him .	163.650508899313
 Blood dripped down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright V woven into the neckline had melted , running a darker color .	349.9742817613146
 The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back .	237.92235182971692
 Can you hear , can you talk to me ?	519.2057088517889
 she begged .	120.0873481626178
 An incoherent , puzzled sound came from the red mouth .	307.9292895032424
 The girl looked around quickly at several of the people .	280.2211754564361
 None of the crowd had stepped forward to help .	509.6041771954548
 Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment .	92.57382355216839
 Why did you do it- why did you hit him ?	832.1556214680863
 she said , her voice rising .	495.002103984877
 Ramey said nothing .	126.59345396094054
 A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again .	445.97503113837354
 Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers .	897.8333037642935
 No one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out .	391.94822985684397
 Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman .	240.97181280029008
 Benson moved his arms , gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly .	572.0572178729404
 Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man .	211.63538050959457
 Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey .	92.56436742715091
 It 's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them .	317.56119571083076
 Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer .	212.0085190250698
 He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman 's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol .	245.52709278862184
 All right , step back !	651.4637244001049
 the patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis .	249.9149816401905
 He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him .	247.9123282393013
 You all right ?	579.3882583392304
 Mough- it 's my mough , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips .	195.9661455671282
 His brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it .	599.0646475858144
 Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head- caught in the wicker back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute .	194.1402228831945
 The body continued to lash , but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome , bloody mass out of the bungalow .	95.21205501712446
 He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots .	144.97217396271083
 He heard their chattering , and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes .	197.79751156427199
 It was only then that he turned to look at Penny .	85.10623710722076
 She was sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her .	165.80938319763467
 The fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth .	213.59580544540148
 But her hands were calm , now .	261.1990096348226
 She 's got guts , thought Keith .	99.36057438220293
 She 's got more guts than any other woman in the world .	151.8790637840178
 Keith , said Penny , Keith , you were wonderful .	56.26002002692046
 I do n't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am .	425.838748975706
 Thank you , Keith .	34.95668044501594
 He smiled at her sincerity .	409.511196879575
 And for the hundredth time that week , he was startled at her beauty .	82.81011844831716
 Strange .	28.000938706861042
 Seven years they 'd been married .	1080.0779054226155
 He knew her mind pretty well , by now , its quick perceptions and sympathies , its painful insistence on truth and directness , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate , even in part .	434.8632957576567
 But her beauty always surprised him anew .	1372.6055679987214
 I realize that this is hardly the time to say it , Penny , said Keith .	113.77707047219992
 But knowing you , I know that you 're glad to be alive , and grateful- and sorry because I killed the snake , even though I had to .	282.95611107972024
 Is n't that so ?	352.4279467676306
 Penny lowered her eyes .	394.79148215299904
 Yes , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime .	151.80608912548988
 The snake was beautiful , was n't it ?	232.55262239574387
 asked Keith , his voice getting harsher in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger .	294.76116637530237
 It was a king cobra , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , did n't it ?	157.19618944941087
 DID N'T IT ?	2193.454518627978
 Penny did not answer .	83.17626424794294
 Now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him .	433.6662325256664
 We 're all God 's creatures , are n't we ?	555.4331116078308
 Keith was snarling now .	26.676112749250525
 All of us- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle .	80.53304730019033
 You love this village and these stinking brown people because they 're God 's creatures , too .	755.4930650073019
 And you love Ahmiri , that black bastard of a servant even a little more , because he 's a beautiful man .	312.69053467110456
 And he loves you because you 're a beautiful woman .	560.7314452006997
 We 're all God 's creatures , are n't we , Penny ?	323.6658555833413
 All of us , that is , except me .	142.8921789934542
 You hate me , you hate my guts , because I like to hunt .	339.02765958330605
 You actually hate me- and we both know it- because I killed that filthy snake .	1290.1728457441498
 h Well , why do n't you say something ?	744.9120344408589
 Penny would not rise to his mood .	105.07605804168976
 There is n't anything left to say , is there , Keith ?	135.3107887002629
 She softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader .	290.45813913090814
 He knew she was not sulking , not even angry at him .	130.3654989479469
 Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him .	381.9474169328165
 The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world , the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet .	82.03629413308353
 For a brief period each year , the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls , and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon , and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long , meandering journey to the sea- running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga , then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam , past the Khasi Hills , and into Bengal , past Sirinjani and Madaripur , until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal .	196.1013273078781
 Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space .	365.5385941480897
 But Keith looked down more than up .	163.40776254770446
 He thought of the jungles below him , and of the wild , strange , untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the lords .	186.07294209960057
 At first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war .	285.97866552959186
 But after the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself .	185.12170665071727
 Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves .	218.75905716850156
 And Keith 's record of kills made him a man to listen to- a man paradoxically , who might even survive .	411.82104763132116
 He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates .	155.68251286413062
 The RAF was Britain 's weapon of attrition , and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war .	367.498445057981
 He knew how to shoot down Nazis .	604.6738271431394
 And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it- because he was chemically incapable of fear .	233.91492557396066
 That was true , but only half the truth .	121.57454214432954
 The other half he did n't like to recognize , even to himself .	201.1539722971654
 He enjoyed the killing .	265.161555044483
 Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity .	769.5590818025859
 He enjoyed killing .	811.4215747166219
 And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi .	214.99802762140195
 Nowadays , we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish .	81.91480941245476
 The Nazis bombed Britain , so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down .	159.31309302056908
 Not quite .	630.1870899391466
 It was a war of nerves , of stamina , of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis , who were better organized and technically superior .	325.0686355243961
 It took a long time before the British tipped the balance .	151.31595858198278
 Keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be risked .	288.375226856619
 They grounded him over his protests- not including his true reason for wanting to fly and put him in the Command offices .	289.94032094526534
 That was where he met Penny .	106.0859857455449
 He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , regardless of how important she might have thought she was in the Command offices , but that was all .	222.46101233125296
 Penny knew him better , on her part .	139.5788723721116
 He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals .	161.3318802044034
 They do n't go for bull-like muscle , as a rule .	164.1720715812064
 He had strength in his six-foot frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier .	61.97675262520649
 He was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep .	77.8622137420975
 His hair was black , already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom , the only one permitted to a man .	104.73008264559239
 The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles- and Penny , hating the cliche , had to admit that in this case it applied .	122.74996055906512
 Keith was an eagle .	17.56947929334223
 Penny and Keith had no romance .	92.2424459445691
 No dates or hand-holding .	188.0325206720613
 But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly .	339.60783342570716
 The Command offices were in the border country , up north , where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports , and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy .	474.43903982425275
 The Nazis knew this , of course , and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit .	374.0361767175624
 This time , they had been lucky .	110.43799735656236
 The Command post was underground , and well camouflaged .	228.77518433815501
 But there had n't been enough time to build it for keeps .	293.5485618925277
 There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as efficacious , when a direct hit comes along .	453.31598980734714
 This one was actually more of a near miss .	299.9382216046638
 The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post , but not precisely into the Command room itself .	373.25225304068687
 There was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks , as ordered .	213.50152334069446
 That is , everyone but Keith and Penny .	65.08972659979895
 They stood there , just the two of them , in the rocking , shattering blast .	116.91064045602693
 Keith was on his feet because he did n't care at all about life any more Penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much .	322.92797717062507
 The bomb was a solitary one .	234.99298530684086
 The blast damaged , but did not destroy the room .	295.85609595026693
 Keith 's eyes met Penny 's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction .	431.7984798050981
 And , as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his .	234.19945711069843
 The chaplain married them , on the next day .	86.30646182205886
 After the war , Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her .	190.15545283814015
 She came from Ohio , from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres , as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers .	360.59746787076415
 But to Keith 's London-bred mind , such acreage sounded rather invincible .	267.2061577598104
 It was n't that , however , which decided them not to go to America .	126.64978938697189
 Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma .	235.79996587629745
 He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles .	90.03962867020046
 He did n't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself .	519.6509347141505
 He could n't stop killing .	416.78846157045837
 That was his true love , not Penny .	99.02753252074545
 The terrible power of a gun , the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose .	190.81915569119042
 And in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing .	226.95836085220503
 When they got to Shillong , in Assam , he was happy .	58.403965038616626
 This is a paradise for hunters .	104.79102446334873
 This was the land of the sladang , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread .	321.5203055714683
 The great black leopards .	88.90648729494984
 The sambur buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk .	68.6797427870439
 He even hunted elephant , although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin .	491.57565910242613
 But there are big rogues in both countries .	197.49256952656194
 These were the ones Keith sought out- the loners , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself .	199.23954949741773
 He and Penny would go out on tame elephants , raised from babyhood in the keddah .	73.35509562785614
 And while he was ever alert for game , and most particularly a tiger , Penny marvelled at the Eden they were traversing .	238.4048313303319
 They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools .	358.38389322558135
 Peacocks strutted across their path , preening .	85.53405997636818
 There were fantastic flowers without perfume , and gaudy birds without song .	768.7470333228118
 Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close .	454.521437298473
 Wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted derision when they did n't consider such game worthy of a shot from the .404 's .	201.7045265346674
 Now , the next morning , they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms , with the weighted line beside it ; and Robinson Roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface .	327.9072668948111
 He and his safety man , Herr Schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together .	142.08920415952315
 The German courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first .	735.9721184382925
 Robinson clambered heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his triple-tank assembly .	501.60561356065637
 He was frowning .	11.246029547231313
 He took his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck .	233.23909817971995
 Temper , temper , Mrs Forsythe said , laughing uneasily .	168.46596225826366
 A phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty , but irreparably stringy in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and tonic , though it was not yet ten AM I loused it , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice .	314.0831671100968
 All I have to do to set the record is to go on down .	194.091881976096
 So instead I come up .	372.8853113448246
 Was it my equipment ?	1598.684581165268
 the German asked .	542.137903955741
 Was it something went bad with the breathing ?	1192.006149200202
 The equipment was fine , Rob stated , standing up .	388.29048362582853
 He was a huge young man of twenty-four , clothed in muscle , immensely strong , with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation .	247.924044921109
 He stared stonily at the floor .	72.77541049229818
 I was down to 275 .	36.07343361573862
 I 've been that far half a dozen times .	498.2382159445097
 I do n't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick .	860.2267157316726
 Well , I get it , Artie said , still on the ladder .	107.6945706238921
 You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record .	279.6780263884897
 And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself .	435.9888735723439
 So you turn around .	469.4712002556399
 No , it was n't that , Rob said .	156.86859118295166
 A note of awe came into his voice .	371.46643907821596
 When I came up , damnit , I thought I was going down .	100.14518441596412
 I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening .	749.5260754396168
 Pressure-happy , Artie said , and climbed in .	78.59900466999433
 That 's right , Robinson said .	175.81397983135545
 I was expecting it , sure .	240.95199892027134
 But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you 're a hundred feet from where you thought you were- well , it makes you think .	280.0999050047518
 You do n't head back down again .	323.46625162459577
 Not me , anyway .	339.89164841166894
 Not right away .	350.94195851045043
 He had his voice under control again no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him .	315.83449800862803
 Waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat .	91.70125916622317
 Now he was going to show how much he knew .	218.83675790480078
 Our boy did n't chicken out , no sir .	569.6762894804982
 He ran into the rapture of the depths .	52.37110434105726
 Nitrogen narcosis .	14.76795937467656
 It makes the diver feel drunk .	215.55269500382667
 Well , that 's the only way to be , Mrs Forsythe said , and gave her brassy laugh .	160.05179423006368
 Maybe not , if you 're 200 feet under water , Artie said .	398.91593398654965
 Anyway , Waddell went on .	81.03943245504863
 it 's nothing to fool with .	639.3163513637292
 It can kill you .	266.5627262323396
 Personally , I do n't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story .	302.0235968578426
 Nobody 's giving anything up , Robinson said .	648.4199188595201
 He stood there , towering over them all gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; and yet like a child among adults .	331.14899470924723
 You think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ?	406.93750275038354
 I 'm going down again .	296.85142712189895
 That 's my boy !	453.23375276453277
 Mr Forsythe exclaimed .	526.5145931253315
 Rob 's not going to give up as easy as all that .	462.71149991373863
 He was a florid , puffy man in his early sixties , very natty in his yachting cap , striped jacket and white flannels .	99.97200358735002
 He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of Commodore was never used without irony .	371.2208760280636
 Old Commodore Forsythe , who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first .	744.2866150501916
 Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again Rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride .	228.99769360830493
 Why , he went on , when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I did n't think twice about it .	239.0526599668464
 I 've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother 's tackle shop .	1055.8858388917915
 Hell , I gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven- how many years ago was it , Rob ?	360.51619565533986
 Seven years ago , Commodore , Rob said impassively .	323.64544693883124
 He was thinking , big deal skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started .	421.81977503894905
 Excuse me , he said abruptly .	168.694974578434
 He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters ; went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him .	215.41156434262993
 When you got ta go , you got ta go , Mrs Forsythe said .	163.14972830407632
 Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge .	506.34994661684107
 He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley .	165.1607567499774
 Hi there , Schaffner , he had said .	26.460826097029052
 Can I make you one ?	626.5351317534798
 No thank you very much , Schaffner had answered in his accented English .	253.3772736046507
 I do not drink so much , thank you .	325.34086208907434
 Waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up .	155.03396613391774
 He was in his early forties , rather short and very compactly built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways .	254.6747399769317
 His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence .	383.6370974798255
 Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel 's Afrika Corps , and he said to himself I 'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night .	120.93259133446713
 Aloud he had said , making conversation Rob tells me he 's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive .	311.6680807218682
 Yes , Herr Schaffner had said .	302.158356468
 He 's one hell of a decent boy .	273.86653232090873
 I like that kid .	427.506971727757
 I agree , yes .	214.83395764877082
 And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right ?	287.2548331164327
 Well , no , Herr Schaffner said .	268.92068537207547
 Waddell turned to face him .	97.14414151151502
 No ?	539.7077398778318
 he asked .	231.48005998646158
 But that 's what he told me .	200.0379760055023
 Why , that 's his main reason for making the dive .	148.49543845731
 Shaffner looked at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands .	200.89123730740408
 What do you mean ?	451.4121181436902
 Waddell asked , frowning .	38.395143928969205
 Please let me explain , the German said earnestly , his face still devoid of deceit .	429.8008790735208
 I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year .	600.5408042100041
 Now I wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong .	266.5239767757761
 I must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products .	368.1905788353678
 With all respect to a fine young man , Mr Roy is not able to provide these necessaries .	236.13315274911497
 Waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard .	108.55018257520112
 Did you tell him all this ?	936.4890190290935
 he asked .	227.4972408843392
 Perhaps not in so many words , the German said .	290.2128905363242
 But surely you have misunderstood Mr Roy .	423.85919279090416
 Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights .	480.63597603709496
 We spoke of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity .	220.99857395786117
 He was most eager to make the dive ; of course , I was willing .	100.08115783450353
 But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements .	487.1866387549887
 Well , damn , Waddell said .	191.7617910099173
 There was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline .	66.33752556605182
 He started out the door .	135.0388987145085
 One moment !	775.4699793815485
 Herr Schaffner said .	329.2762240238778
 You intend to speak with Mr Roy ?	957.9297723808336
 What else ?	453.248320336532
 Waddell asked .	69.00077544620875
 If you will pardon , I think it would be better if not .	159.78575866015717
 Mr Roy is determined to make this dive .	185.16699053687188
 Whatever you tell him he will dive .	218.90812735581287
 I know this from my talks with him .	296.3093410836104
 Well , let 's let him make up his own mind , OK ?	273.12153627136314
 Waddell said .	34.69687926768763
 On the basis of the facts .	50.17996373154546
 You will make him unhappy and anxious , the German said .	374.68940691075005
 At 200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him .	364.13450777668345
 It is not good , Mr Waddell you will do him great harm .	232.57349870562484
 There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said .	348.47465234048593
 Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .	157.41720672255857
 I am an honest man , the German said with fervor .	182.4076091926617
 I will give Mr Roy his due for this dive .	304.7275153731237
 I will make him distributor for all of Florida- a big market .	297.1291140575051
 All tourists come to Florida .	1100.2982348802304
 This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop .	311.40147121403436
 Yes !	2204.0251164858787
 But there is no use causing him to worry at this time .	216.94381861714564
 The German 's words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty .	210.1735554073968
 He took a big swig of his drink .	94.78756774816007
 It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this .	240.54765653448118
 I think maybe you 're right , Schaffner , he said .	204.63100746236765
 He has the distributorship for Florida , you say ?	140.42875398969457
 Yes , the German said .	209.91924795583657
 At least for South Florida .	795.243722074498
 By God , Waddell said , we do n't want to upset the boy at this time of all times .	176.7416468367319
 I guess you 're right .	722.4922506397036
 He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps .	88.04636032516076
 The story was shaping up nicely in his mind the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America .	371.9870603068042
 Join me in another ?	1083.405359398605
 he had asked .	142.1693583122978
 Thank you , the German had said courteously .	77.90819044875049
 I do not drink so much .	232.5776462489269
 Now , in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk .	654.958477822428
 Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions .	305.9866335465607
 He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper .	277.678465032677
 Blessed Saint Nicholas , I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered .	489.28387969307255
 And when I make the dive again- He paused ; crossed himself ; said a Hail Mary , slowly and with understanding .	740.2368139747072
 Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to Headquarters .	419.2259769445631
 Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive .	352.93561147285055
 Make it come off all right .	771.0858518719756
 Let me set the record this time , and let me get back OK , so the German will give me the exclusive .	360.20914664179935
 And make my life different and better from this time on .	421.8122740945102
 Amen .	3675.0008800951255
 He crossed himself again and rose .	278.77390007456813
 He felt a good deal less shaky .	150.31243458052444
 As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk .	229.4564958305168
 Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger .	59.344301036857246
 He waited awhile before he said , Roy , you know your decompression table , do n't you ?	223.03759348430316
 You know I know it , Robinson answered warily .	289.7594877129985
 You came straight up from 275 without a stop , Artie said .	194.57149208651902
 Well , I was a little bit confused .	238.9509178092422
 Anyway , I was n't down long enough to matter .	129.5690821398087
 You do n't see me stretched out on the deck , do you ?	357.902340540987
 You know what they say about two deep dives in one day , Artie went on , still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently .	176.30101262413694
 I do n't think you should go down again .	297.1172389397616
 EARLY that day Matsuo saw a marine .	198.87114525034312
 The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery .	278.89336253514927
 As his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand .	209.02333129926797
 He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed .	334.7394396262574
 In the leafiest part of the tree , straddling a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow .	69.43242854832023
 For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .	431.3971359999452
 He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably bred indecision , they would soon come hunting .	262.42727251325607
 His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure .	396.5429889908714
 Yesterday ; today ; tomorrow no surrender .	691.1882342051667
 His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace- only a faint chill of doubt .	485.19806139430193
 He murmured to himself , with firmness No surrender .	289.489214929945
 It was best to die fighting the marines .	154.58633645495897
 His superiors had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor .	351.4000168861783
 What if the marines never came ?	143.33983828028954
 His comrades were all dead .	523.1914725401391
 He had no rice .	126.69171479830732
 Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .	304.30452754195136
 Whichever the way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes .	197.06767085456636
 He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk .	165.2336541205235
 His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .	819.4205779417167
 The knife , an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt .	304.9977876100862
 Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth .	546.0032184693542
 As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing .	157.58834199790482
 Gloom receded .	14.848705711421008
 The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though debating whether to brave the sunlight .	286.6436437551395
 His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist .	193.5557364688737
 Come out , come out in the meadow , Matsuo said under his breath .	129.59173455252593
 The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face .	321.90559994201016
 A signal ?	504.14216541204837
 Matsuo lifted his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness .	249.5317696023852
 Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills .	351.2240472037736
 They had fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out .	128.7956279294759
 Even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows .	129.1378640857916
 A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing .	170.35437442416293
 The marines let him advance .	218.8054668392172
 When he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy .	182.21644103023218
 Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses , both the burned and the unburned , the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun .	107.83850778282701
 The callous marines had laughed at each other 's retching , while stacking bodies .	172.98761462607163
 Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea .	66.51039330270385
 At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle , reeking of death .	83.4087576349051
 Apprehensively he peered to the left , to the right into the leafy , vine-crisscrossed maze .	58.11250421289204
 He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow , with the one left to distract him .	49.05375912644997
 He strained his hearing .	401.2555123005109
 Cautious feet stepping on leafmold ; faint creaking of belts and slings ; whispers he heard none of these .	326.74535714293194
 Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird .	164.7723990622239
 Because he could n't hear them , he was more convinced they were there .	199.55638010585062
 A spectacle occurred across the meadow the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it .	149.66976541687058
 Humiliation made Matsuo tremble .	193.9470631044464
 While his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver .	245.1142007842294
 Taking aim at the man 's face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind .	233.63759127713018
 He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .	222.53875439996366
 The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound .	216.59948810900738
 Hush followed .	114.3964518359973
 Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment , Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle .	308.28010505410504
 How stupid to give his position away .	403.64565630755624
 The jungle did not retort .	27.360784817565747
 The sitter remained seated hugging the tree .	757.7986342316734
 Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy , and insects hummed and birds occasionally called .	244.95675387253513
 Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke .	214.1263180005079
 Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes .	1310.2497380804648
 He went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind chasing of the tail .	168.81183805352214
 It ended when he tumbled ; but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction .	277.76797013963983
 He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon .	424.1883207069367
 With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo 's direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop .	63.40726763758775
 When he got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face .	253.79237097583936
 The pockets of his jacket bulged .	150.37137463236877
 Hand grenades .	5604.402936565911
 the bobbing head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk .	120.5879684450139
 The marine spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward .	198.77103743943113
 In the hush that followed the echoes , Matsuo was tense .	108.17780164975798
 They could come on him now without difficulty .	242.11074110407316
 Gradually he reached a conclusion .	118.28411042213493
 The marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree .	264.4800893177591
 Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage .	454.31334788854736
 The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended .	1178.8791029142014
 Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out .	253.01210529556127
 Reflex ?	61.10215410854262
 Rifle leveled on the man , he made a rush .	106.17895872915918
 Heat , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd .	391.07757159581007
 He squatted by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground .	158.40748315793653
 With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back .	360.04343730475574
 He was bearded .	144.34309333372968
 The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone ; around the hole , blood glistened in a little patch .	191.26214591137503
 Maintaining his clutch on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets .	181.84144422610194
 In one a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man 's bleeding .	188.64149544985543
 In the other a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief .	280.53021466656276
 One by one he tossed the objects aside .	606.795073469368
 He did n't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter ; he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running .	383.65196338194863
 Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .	345.49109791863606
 Too bad the marine had no water .	607.1711729649594
 From its holder he took his own canteen .	191.70219213729368
 The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure .	264.236049829308
 The marine 's eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened squinted in the glare .	227.10363902026694
 So , alive .	245.97624592459152
 Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .	195.0607180307962
 The marine reached up a hand .	308.29572807344965
 Matsuo shook his head .	166.16963313069044
 None for you .	576.4421053377738
 The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand .	263.6303945556373
 Not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on .	268.76960464278113
 You came well equipped to die .	603.814654615141
 Some odor made him lean over the man .	565.995642458371
 He sniffed and recognized it .	70.6826775320603
 Sake .	28.07081790548666
 So that had been his difficulty .	135.35215384371705
 Drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac .	79.45702115707083
 The marine tried to roll on his right side , and moaned .	197.67272754444357
 When he rolled on the left side , propping on his left elbow , Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over .	233.55378058492465
 Be a good turtle .	1946.7189841302238
 Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle .	285.46987920216696
 The smell of sake had freshened yesterday 's events in his thoughts .	346.47811811286067
 In the caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake .	147.71057326577582
 The marine shut his eyes .	622.4574308827948
 Are you a thrower of flame , marine ?	462.26567094017764
 Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine 's reach and away from their shadows .	205.2012803061705
 He waited in his squat , gripping the hair .	65.61438005193767
 Every so often he turned the knife .	495.54665846897325
 Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .	801.6252346765241
 The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping .	141.46985478581374
 Wet also were the marine 's fatigues and the face had an oily film .	202.71965511013656
 The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes .	223.6575334688456
 Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle .	262.73687700274485
 He must have saturated himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze .	148.9378280542581
 Matsuo shook his head .	165.23100886487975
 Strange .	28.00026965765024
 At last he reached for the knife .	256.5880030892413
 Even the bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine 's handkerchief to wrap it .	163.20008051488418
 First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes .	332.92530843920025
 The marine yelled and flung the hand away .	95.99087847900552
 With a firm grip on the man 's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek .	482.7095380418293
 A shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo 's wrist .	64.41897297394993
 Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat ; burned the other cheek ; burned each hand when they came groping again .	528.5554605645226
 The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment .	415.13044800073345
 Matsuo stood up .	73.72344009748511
 A small measure of payment , marine .	564.8690771020067
 He dropped the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder .	244.25534261791404
 The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach .	255.14415569804672
 He ceased weeping .	1023.7915830867768
 Matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back .	199.5688004686514
 The marine was still .	195.84067638171342
 He would soon die .	224.33400681061622
 As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow .	193.28315692507374
 What now ?	216.57135821831332
 In the jungle , birds were mute , while insects preserved only the monotony of living .	186.24149885582136
 Someone called .	1688.3233937537766
 It was the marine head lifted , he strained and called .	446.12951595702543
 Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat .	297.4471254098271
 He cupped his mouth and yelled .	39.77272036164739
 Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder .	177.80598423089108
 Once and for all he 'd finish this marine who would not die .	581.2473283613147
 He aimed , but listened .	214.05639065132905
 It sounded as if the man were calling him Hey , Japanese h hey there , Japanese .	326.5804806776408
 The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container .	246.9597666521846
 He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .	463.8303927248936
 Sake ?	61.13482239276691
 Matsuo called .	120.31265853520084
 The marine nodded vigorously .	2330.4080652666253
 Matsuo laughed , slung the rifle .	112.4221926119066
 The marine was a winehead .	50.59602791791061
 His superiors had said that all marines were depraved .	49.370608247971155
 The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol .	642.527918027803
 Remembering his own thirst , Matsuo took out his water bottle .	177.86597643322193
 One swallow was all he would have ; he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline .	241.35222524715402
 His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline .	215.78016599270296
 He began to uncap the bottle , the rusty cap squealing on its threads .	137.2197327792189
 Popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted .	390.12239751737746
 Of course it was water he really craved ; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out .	179.0795232645627
 The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack .	482.4132995528086
 Matsuo shook his head .	164.39971209034115
 He had no water for an enemy .	108.28711493928397
 And when this was gone , he had n't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool .	174.56070560254162
 He capped the bottle and replaced it .	122.18479899935537
 After all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine .	230.1630100198505
 Before much longer the marine quieted down .	337.8626415901628
 His head slumped .	85.09186090504805
 The upper part of his packet had stained dark .	184.41720882734967
 Marine .	3491.412449920188
 There is nothing for you , Matsuo said .	89.46093642932532
 Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion , besides the dishonor of it .	191.38210555866897
 I 've nothing for you .	344.7511920246646
 From the convulsive quivers of the man 's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping .	171.67059630333748
 He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China .	310.12674197916533
 In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , smudged , blood-specked , with the village burning about him and shells exploding .	314.51147646045797
 CHAIRS SCRAPED BACK and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar .	1145.4686301245965
 Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were .	580.1659928559462
 Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame .	256.8268174397241
 He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed .	145.61880793893405
 Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys ?	332.83121646079167
 he asked .	229.3874575026909
 Seems to me I do n't remember altering any law about that .	349.429583978802
 He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer .	476.06643156330495
 Stay right here where you are , kid , he called .	279.17009769184165
 I do n't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I 'm a-drinking The stranger ignored him .	685.0382414207476
 He did n't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader 's right hand was on the butt of his revolver .	463.2720324947655
 I 'm Billy Tilghman , said the stranger , and I 've come for Pat Conyers ' body .	384.73974842724243
 And what makes you think you 're going to get it , pretty boy ?	569.930897204213
 Because I 'm asking .	665.4956243253023
 Most of the time I get what I ask for .	346.77563275483783
 Blue Throat winked at his six cronies .	104.41223998689543
 The kid has no manners , boys .	573.2960058041613
 Shall we teach him some ?	2062.3209897002894
 His gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster .	237.7067056555665
 Tilghman 's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin .	263.3234915343401
 His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling .	259.57432865123235
 Tilghman leapt on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him careening against the bar .	143.3767960387939
 A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman 's stomach as Blue Throat 's henchmen started shooting .	584.5628869384227
 Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun .	420.8162492667774
 The Colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing .	254.96110579672498
 A third shot doused the light .	185.03638253214731
 Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , You all right , Billy ?	353.5195170182857
 Yes , George , but I ai n't got poor old Pat 's body yet .	1233.4273537152208
 And I aim to have it .	141.82306082115048
 He fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed .	302.01168791150496
 Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor .	335.45496603657745
 OK , Tilghman , I 'm quitting .	30.917315522178093
 And me , said another Blue Throat henchman .	169.70512312863843
 Somebody brought a light .	872.3307350150877
 Tilghman and his partner , George Rust , herded the men into a corner .	112.08741574194572
 And now , said Tilghman with deadly calm , I 'll repeat what I said .	311.5856541927476
 I 've come for Pat Conyers ' body .	623.6925992275092
 In two minutes the body of Tilghman 's former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town 's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial .	323.2305311510605
 Blue Throat , nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight .	388.4063382945789
 That critter will be back tomorrow , predicted George Rust , and he 'll bring fifty of his kind back with him .	239.21040213343818
 Blue Throat wo n't stand for this .	739.9534908945244
 He 'll shoot up the town .	224.82892917633748
 The prediction was correct .	230.06471796911603
 The Reverend James Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers ' last rites on Boot Hill in the township of Petrie , when shots were heard in the distance .	230.4395050736289
 Amen , said the Reverend Doran , grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone , and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere .	208.34859432570644
 Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle .	351.3355551634638
 Blue Throat , who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months , certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship .	293.9521206235871
 It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring , ruthless gun-slinger , and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it .	223.30686689519868
 He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street .	194.87720350439136
 The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn .	253.51562156007193
 Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat 's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire .	1115.5148531293662
 The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster 's Store , halfway down the street .	148.6901562798636
 Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived .	979.090468104229
 He sized up the situation and shook his head .	115.7264639609657
 If Blue Throat has his way he 'll keep us all cooped up in here for days , he said .	276.02440057247316
 There 's only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store .	229.65843181684397
 He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom .	198.2372147019539
 Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite .	772.2554845145703
 I 'm gon na drop these into Blue Throat 's lap , he announced , and I 'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window .	602.7449768110338
 He slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways .	128.32888398671787
 Blue Throat 's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed .	437.0810305238025
 Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber 's shop and came out at the back .	209.35163542383478
 Here he could n't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang .	242.6470918192523
 All he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through .	252.47145874618758
 Billy Tilghman did just that .	352.20096058053645
 Within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters , with every outlaw either dead or injured inside .	385.91741129544704
 It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat 's dictatorship in Petrie .	150.66326602163937
 Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts .	744.9551451448301
 To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising , smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet .	322.49788806760347
 Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West , Uncle Billy Tilghman stands out head and shoulders .	574.0503443608233
 He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book .	148.92384418387113
 He saw the most action , beat up more badmen with his bare fists , broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other US marshal who lived before or after him .	363.67109239149073
 For fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West .	463.6597864810838
 The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career , his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung .	229.60779124353292
 Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century .	355.74156001122867
 He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890 's .	342.5325990297086
 Led by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns .	404.2084607294272
 Bill Doolin 's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him .	245.12132778403037
 Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .	66.76096421229579
 They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses .	253.6527327607004
 Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort .	1150.179297211803
 On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn 's ranch .	481.3457944976427
 It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .	302.73428587220695
 The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was belching out thick smoke .	335.0240032181782
 The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .	513.6854776591737
 Wait here , Neal , said Tilghman .	127.23596052141995
 If I do n't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse .	600.188534216146
 Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it .	95.73283401916616
 There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside .	312.8804118768951
 Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day .	1012.4407772505524
 Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed Dunn .	274.8727785996896
 Hello , Ed , said Tilghman .	95.7255751803142
 The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but did n't move .	255.3138987710787
 Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire .	285.4302491240609
 Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck .	240.86537549238912
 Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain .	384.6918698748821
 And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman .	226.7202455390301
 The fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide .	327.47750498381697
 Thinking fast , Tilghman never hesitated for one instant .	418.75803453084797
 He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him .	289.5168743402616
 The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang- every man a killer .	311.3043721978268
 Cold day , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire .	300.99894966397204
 Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives .	482.9237920547722
 Ca n't seem to locate landmarks in this snow .	501.3802043274668
 The rancher was trembling .	329.8214394695196
 He would n't look Tilghman in the face .	65.62083152631591
 Follow the river for five miles , he said hoarsely .	271.04813879717364
 Jed 's homestead is on the south bank .	89.01770163904706
 Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes .	536.6463333235745
 All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body .	640.5854547348353
 One false move on his part and he would be a dead man .	238.08479893297425
 Well , he announced , Guess I 'll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the warmup .	150.5749259009918
 He strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him .	97.19934103321272
 He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive .	657.2699557238029
 But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon .	418.3137258972887
 If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .	612.4427969958446
 Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown .	262.60940466497493
 Do n't say or do anything , he said softly .	313.20754339959785
 Just get out of here without it looking as though we 're in a hurry .	539.3087777474839
 That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang .	198.74552996078847
 Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman 's life hung on a thread .	664.3634611383121
 Back in the house a hoodlum named Red Buck , sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then .	627.4194852424375
 You 'll stay right here , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle .	849.8911548831879
 Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back .	269.1297562131956
 We 'll let him go .	342.3750659014683
 But the fighting marshal 's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , Oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets .	403.8683394789663
 Wiley Lynn , a self-styled prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since .	974.1230396486321
 That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy 's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver .	659.5499191191217
 FOR SEVERAL MONTHS now , Jack Carter , a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy , pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a Woman .	127.00556775901559
 This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth ; she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately .	275.87343716062327
 When she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach .	404.45648750055614
 Then he would run to the toilet behind the house .	167.84184193034972
 Sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this Woman was almost always with him .	206.39542093022368
 He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him .	348.71177296915624
 But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right .	282.9664322738238
 And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the Woman of Jack 's mind assumed the teacher 's face and figure .	215.97056252100066
 He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do .	214.12393411988296
 When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh .	156.3431730912719
 Miss Langford her first name was Evelyn was an attractive girl .	383.9083846615712
 Tall , blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress .	242.0640100960787
 Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack .	268.5318078262686
 She would look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick .	220.50381283186314
 School began in August , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another .	229.30489073790218
 The first two or three days they went home early .	690.0556078054
 All , that is , except Jack .	214.23999589801412
 He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order .	204.50630289373802
 Once this was on the third day of school she kneeled down to pick up some books where they 'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg .	392.54632752059973
 He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating .	415.9332896237403
 About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she did n't even see him .	238.5687721211224
 He jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school .	122.09475673735729
 He did n't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; then he slowed to a walk .	193.01647321056703
 The vision became even stronger now .	521.1666715046427
 I 'll get her yet , he muttered to himself .	324.53025998747444
 I 've got to get her .	351.39850623595663
 That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire .	264.7884321898049
 He ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily .	363.01033051395285
 What 's the matter , honey ?	274.02953423455716
 she said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child .	96.96699478534907
 Are n't you hungry ?	2036.5768484844134
 No , I 'm not hungry , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs .	203.0336407370695
 Outside it was already hot at 730 AM , and it was getting hot in the kitchen .	469.44249704960896
 He felt a little sick at his stomach .	239.16864447127125
 Are you sick ?	2660.552844046059
 No , he said .	61.377858585028555
 I 'll be all right .	175.74294477366536
 I guess it 's this hot weather .	648.8711266230242
 Do n't you play hard today then .	1224.006654440176
 And if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early .	694.4769831934717
 Daddy left the car for me , and I 'm going to town this afternoon .	250.0464345482128
 O K , I wo n't play hard , he promised .	796.0677373069017
 Just then Charles Lever yelled , Hey , Jack , from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling Good-bye , Mom over his shoulder .	204.40345931045653
 Whaddya say , boy ?	247.16320632647168
 Charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth .	496.04146731341643
 Charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , scraggly , with straight black hair like an Indian 's and sharp brown eyes .	505.2836897144009
 He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .	366.309277419365
 You know what I done last night ?	1026.8801941524976
 Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .	346.8934569237687
 Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were Charles ' only apparent interest .	505.6143044540969
 But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles ' revelations even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention , so he usually invited them , as he did now .	367.699426217625
 No .	365.12911922397535
 What ?	194.32935529431418
 I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry .	268.72922028898785
 A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack 's mind .	727.0848422629444
 His heart beat faster .	1879.8961661325045
 Hell you say ?	212.9190603136371
 he said , lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles .	201.82533656387872
 How 'd you do it ?	389.65784114299873
 Hell , I jist got on top of- No , I mean how 'd you get her to do it ?	315.9611183831658
 Hell , I jist ask her .	103.79499947228896
 Jist like that ?	147.96871928242197
 Hell , yes .	65.84778139304541
 She 's been hangin ' around me a lot here lately , and I figgered I might as well 's try it .	320.79620959691624
 Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin ' it .	373.7491808788011
 I never heard that .	232.72690626198127
 It 's all over Branchville .	65.19781075712748
 If you 'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself .	554.5877062930787
 I might try it one of these days , Jack said wonderingly , thinking of Miss Langford .	268.76664209800447
 WHEN THEY reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse .	432.19965766640007
 Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .	159.59064993953993
 Time for books , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand .	329.12244571474815
 Let 's go inside .	547.7504942545726
 Oh , come on Miss Langford , play with us just onct , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully .	166.7486314829746
 No , not now , said the teacher .	139.75273204369807
 Maybe at dinner time .	1117.0927551814946
 Come inside now .	1254.1873006985882
 The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse .	128.08772498190368
 Jack watched Miss Langford all morning .	1086.3367887544457
 He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider .	637.3036051902526
 Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he coud hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did .	408.69320014527057
 At noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball .	429.8397834726663
 Why ai n't you playin ' ball ?	911.5485129513451
 he asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse .	165.93645818978408
 Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised , several of the little girls called .	344.1451000883475
 I 'd druther stay here and watch the girls , Charles grinned .	692.040391808795
 Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we 'll see up their dress .	826.7699823464089
 Maybe , Jack said idly , watching for Miss Langford .	331.8114684598019
 Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .	125.74352733576204
 When she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , Goody , goody .	139.57897587553853
 Let 's play with 'em , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants .	310.50936695416124
 OK Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls .	252.58667693043228
 They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap .	624.3155855723456
 Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head .	284.9033140563832
 While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , Gosh , I 'm sorry , Miss Langford .	350.05550675874997
 I did n't mean to pull so hard .	311.65414865673506
 That 's all right , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes .	189.70033978033277
 It was my fault .	144.75929538427755
 With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack 's extended hand with the other .	754.3570247660618
 When her hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet .	588.7690096795353
 He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .	336.0808789895489
 Thank you , she said , dusting herself off .	123.3150304609893
 Will you play with us again , Miss Langford ?	467.399410528362
 one of the little girls said .	177.44496399096363
 No more today .	289.5315835435248
 Maybe some other day .	529.5527831843233
 Oh , shucks , the girl said .	78.91668305423272
 I do n't believe I 'll play any more neither .	848.8476136940403
 Me neither , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone .	495.5428051911743
 Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun , past Robert Allen 's three-room , tarpapered house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes .	351.21972703286986
 When he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up .	60.81778376056976
 He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class .	254.93852570253276
 That should do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work .	219.75531455688758
 He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he could n't take a chance on either of these possibilities the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school .	313.7983248563029
 The only drawback now to the plan he 'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack .	406.8346714750123
 But I 've got to take a chance on it , he told himself desperately .	278.4199620371743
 To his surprise his plan worked perfectly .	1081.1068717865353
 All right , if you ca n't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school it out , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling .	449.38761227011514
 You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems .	1445.3345835710174
 And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home .	325.4680585206169
 He scarcely saw them .	227.22212427231153
 His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , How will I do it ?	371.22638788426497
 On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise .	206.0570981443802
 She munched little ginger cakes called mulatto 's belly and kept her green , somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck .	568.429144182983
 The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman .	333.8382000657563
 Lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family .	194.2024518972038
 The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured Look at your watch , Col Garvier .	479.1934707096071
 It is almost time for and calinda to begin .	144.80753161772373
 Col Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans ' most important and enlightened slave owners .	1773.3313055166773
 He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start .	175.6280291352638
 The slaves ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name .	394.8068079059158
 Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum .	720.0011856586656
 He showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently , his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy .	101.48034313487658
 The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds .	230.53368777179327
 The dance was of Haitian origin .	147.7918752009219
 The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows .	248.1509533929355
 He was possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners .	158.65858394887294
 He proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the South 's oldest and most cherished names .	288.179203210773
 Delphine was a pace-setter in high society .	51.34825219415475
 She was a top horsewoman and one of the city 's most gracious hostesses .	112.99978078155787
 Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil .	208.9963603687073
 Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders .	524.0072619186317
 The slender , handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves .	245.15688966339982
 He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race .	461.44839482494325
 But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his master 's plantation in Bayou St John .	288.55830447853435
 Shy , actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls ' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses .	246.20991517664254
 This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near .	581.6490632052944
 The woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection .	317.4086763579694
 What is your name , boy ?	321.68501936292733
 Come a bit closer .	1852.2082139111963
 I wo n't bite , you know .	412.2840978353048
 He gaped at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her .	252.16025714471218
 Then he smiled shyly .	127.31496538331216
 My name is Dandy Brandon , missy .	63.2556329288187
 I belong to Master Alexander Prieur .	575.8710863120357
 She said with intense feeling Come near , let me feel your arms .	1564.8719837304116
 You look quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy .	326.64315556460315
 Mrs Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage .	523.7087158985481
 Lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm .	210.51165096347108
 The woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor .	108.20923601038223
 Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees .	249.65384358130214
 Satisfied at last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver .	215.22945751535497
 This was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows .	35.593852030158914
 Aristide !	67.96896199700774
 I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy 's purchase .	360.1151814410621
 There 's $ 600 in gold in this chamois sack .	102.98268790078735
 If the old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer .	578.4461092349655
 Prieur has gout and depends on Louis ' pills and bleedings .	113.0250053136598
 Besides , he owns 300 slaves .	1007.7000205929238
 One less should n't matter to him .	267.327759814536
 Aristide Devol , the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native Sierra Leone , smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat .	141.89433069643627
 His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .	346.64594764609944
 Another youth , Madame ?	1201.4205498458005
 the coachman said softly .	191.39824628462216
 This one is a tender chicken , oui ?	311.17868397810616
 Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh .	1530.9484398543734
 It will rip and shred easily for Madame .	180.74903317187986
 Be quiet , Devol !	439.09502256964873
 You are forgetting your place .	198.76972217866103
 The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur .	251.00868255793804
 Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon- cowering in the back seat of the carriage- to her mansion at 677 Perdido Street .	78.6294903776485
 Dr Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion .	164.11210946305067
 Dandy , curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle .	183.35117349176338
 He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head .	183.29371341381133
 Dr Lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket , and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses .	164.86410859737362
 He was about 50 years old .	340.8461423074252
 Another young man , my dear ?	651.3009099862935
 Really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself , he said , frowning with displeasure .	92.21750891422367
 Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster .	84.05666465976209
 Dandy is to be our house guest , Louis .	283.8071005023303
 I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways .	370.7320668773359
 He deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation .	225.78002929521452
 Quite so , my dear .	675.0339678768207
 His room will be ready shortly .	517.8517414493915
 The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave .	259.00366023173814
 Had Dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries ' tender care if he valued his life .	326.3022268792229
 But he liked the smell of Delphine 's perfume .	183.90570184275813
 Besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth .	190.28587832583915
 Also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony .	276.7078318088482
 So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home .	147.8059592049718
 Airless and dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St John .	301.79486258727235
 He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie- after closing the door- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber .	325.21278505190213
 It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell .	190.2419679442898
 When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street , he was carried out in a coroner 's basket .	120.7042289821334
 JUST six weeks after Dandy Brandon 's arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New Orleans ' oldest and wealthiest families were invited .	337.8121858466984
 A stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms , and Delphine circulated graciously among her guests , chatting airily of the forthcoming races , the latest fashions from Paris , and Louisiana politics .	217.84239269263873
 Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase .	102.6329630588621
 It was Dandy Brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him .	70.70197128155114
 The lad 's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts .	436.0258539014485
 His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .	153.88503236737466
 Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted Evil woman !	632.9854933059418
 You did this h you like to hurt h to beat people h I want h to go home .	561.3388868169745
 These were the last words he ever uttered .	433.91104928770943
 Convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore .	116.99393317490298
 Dr Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead .	400.2346332109179
 The ball broke up in confusion .	502.1289481558896
 Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures .	696.9923341383342
 Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse .	222.13807573031113
 But at the coroner 's inquest Delphine told a forthright story .	49.15120943654132
 I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him .	442.2974066123182
 It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest .	332.3416404238848
 After I paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night .	271.5639308444042
 How he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , I can not say .	135.2624859595158
 Dr Lalaurie and I did n't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs .	204.1979810903014
 She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion That poor boy !	568.2266606704526
 He must have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced .	326.41365661457155
 Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die .	504.92687399149634
 Such a pitiful end !	165.90555813813734
 Though the slave 's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner 's panel , Dandy 's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded .	155.28416586331826
 The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury did n't feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady .	153.21553073240918
 Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans ' dives .	1182.4189693867377
 So the verict was death at the hands of a person or persons unknown , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine 's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold .	152.50822573210883
 Once again life went its serene way- soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners .	1215.1997270202996
 The excitement over Brandon 's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie 's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital .	357.2834690343469
 Then , on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip .	271.5814181763355
 Mrs Victor Dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight .	406.24879481683826
 The manservant Devol and his mistress , Delphine Lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion .	52.546066285941365
 The girl was not more than 16 .	179.63218134575874
 She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back .	442.20872245754657
 The bleeding girl was tiring fast ; the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street .	324.6220229040195
 The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice Help me , somebody !	183.97409016570364
 They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw !	518.0010372061934
 Bastards , he would say , all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me !	151.55884007226624
 Since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent- and even indecent- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero , he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper .	185.9051171829334
 There ai n't nothin ' faster , or lonelier , or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wan na go someplace , Feathertop would say .	169.80473056132035
 The accommodations may not be the poshest , but man !	101.81978921070849
 there ai n't nobody askin ' for your ticket stub , neither .	896.2959387705756
 He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now .	76.38183354593218
 Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child .	76.57036626486097
 Ever since all that .	665.6603741799186
 It had been a very long time that had no form and no end .	112.84496353688682
 He was- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own- riding the dark train out .	171.01757917740986
 Out and out and never to return again .	346.79777946551826
 Till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped .	166.51344437461665
 That was the day it ended .	164.0844055396315
 THE FREIGHT CAR WAS COLD , early in the morning .	129.75821048587648
 He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .	125.31677740549428
 He held his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly .	131.3996933637838
 The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn- then with a clash into its slot .	291.4835881324941
 The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .	155.4659482639392
 She pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and Feathertop 's music pffft-ed away .	449.0087864924
 Now that is a very nice , a very nice , he murmured to himself , back in his corner .	207.25771511062322
 A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted .	252.56736423197995
 Hot , that was the word , hot !	278.7164518661926
 Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow 's wings , with the sun shining down over them .	144.48398813751444
 A poet , yet !	216.07476617435842
 His thoughts for the swanlike neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however .	218.89605341891559
 Zingggg-O !	67.71588380957708
 Then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting .	385.8294136351598
 He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .	156.69677543750166
 Curly hair , high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer 's blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes- but then I 'm finished .	216.78305773761755
 We made it , Cappy , the chick said .	34.69636789714254
 Yeah , seems so , do n't it , the boy laughed , hugging her close .	144.18482964468006
 Ah-ah !	68.15118250742778
 Feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants .	47.19606285222813
 None of that .	356.089205953793
 We run a respectable house here .	489.7101181030927
 They whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall .	267.1781779176692
 He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes .	123.19823109331325
 He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .	471.4541822779991
 Come sit , said Feathertop , motioning them toward him .	195.16106527152053
 That crap is softer over here .	80.61969368324071
 The girl smiled , and started forward .	316.0664861425281
 The boy yanked her back hard , tugging her off her feet , and gathered her into the crook of his arm .	173.40536603546158
 Now stay with me , Kitty , he snapped irritably .	139.08456820121268
 I vowed to take care of you- and that 's what I 'm gon na do .	168.41036577534305
 We do n't know this guy .	370.41522824434725
 Oooo , square bit , Feathertop screwed his face up .	351.5943196643462
 This guy was strictly from Outsville .	238.9198724853384
 But nowhere !	837.4820350588743
 What is with this vow jazz ?	197.2188649274386
 Feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight 's vibrating wall .	146.27076494871892
 We- we eloped , Cappy said .	33.78428216113025
 His head came up and he said it defiantly .	137.18860112749067
 Well , congratulations .	53.11902413469765
 Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .	272.3923651644416
 These two were going to be easy pickins .	175.4726117459274
 They could n't have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much .	160.88152262148253
 And besides , the chick had a little something the others did n't have .	200.99923535125097
 That was gon na be fun collecting !	543.0259503848129
 But not just yet .	213.1762203870679
 Feathertop was a connoisseur .	11.173770795396612
 He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it .	126.66232011579726
 Come sit , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings .	265.7437093647078
 I 'm just a poor ex-jazz man , name of- uh- Boyd Smith .	201.01524202225264
 He grinned at them wolfishly .	148.51941823070413
 That ai n't your name , Mister , the boy accused .	247.14864340193742
 And you know- you 're right !	359.81090762454403
 Feathertop aimed a finger at him .	226.124893822625
 Oh , come on , Cappy , the girl chided .	98.92033169316268
 He 's okay .	17.329955497764264
 He 's a nice guy .	385.7316499761408
 She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her .	806.9727176607474
 Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle .	333.8563226624047
 He cleared his throat ; it had been a long , hot while since he 'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin ' distance .	481.6285892690171
 He had it all doped , of course .	56.48694587954924
 Slug the kid , grab his dough- at least enough to get to Philadelphia- and then have a rockin ' ball with the doll .	172.4388452561062
 Hmm- diddle !	39.55811600104291
 Where 'd you come from , Mr- uh- Mr Smith ?	621.1030867546448
 Kitty inquired politely .	97.96285531235145
 Where from ?	1347.1745633928488
 he mused .	55.31346100600307
 Out .	646.9882102549792
 I been riding train for a ways now .	496.5153783860803
 They lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself .	125.43400856906838
 After a while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , We 'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly , honey .	366.0253147347306
 What 's the matter , she wan na go the bathroom ?	226.95845743750846
 Ernie found it immensely funny .	1423.8353005390197
 The boy scowled at him , and the girl looked shocked .	142.50520431760089
 No !	1241.8402938918287
 Certainly not , I mean , no that is n't what I said !	310.35943911088833
 she snapped at him .	469.080135828532
 I only said I was hungry .	317.31715508461707
 We have n't had anything to eat all day .	300.0399038859793
 Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill 's voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .	492.97535334024815
 Why n't ya say so , fellow travelers !	997.9450930860147
 Why , we got dinner right here .	491.5549312042818
 C'mon , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we 'll have food in a minute or two .	347.84373306439124
 Cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .	50.543278700512026
 Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .	984.345939570903
 He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it .	515.3737675336922
 He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .	323.8421522620933
 A charcoal pit , man , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier .	130.1924194375325
 Fan it , he told Cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper .	83.84452623838035
 Yeah , but what 're we gon na eat ?	187.21114636240145
 Charcoal ?	60.95219329736033
 Fella , Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man , you try my ever-lovin ' patience .	216.71430770425553
 He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners .	334.0443846302745
 Hot dogs , man .	1201.5986593676778
 Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides .	248.2195816165954
 He ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil .	254.88042570127354
 Almost immediately they began to sizzle .	256.2283545001211
 He looked up and grinned .	194.77451955719778
 A Kroger 's self-serve , he explained .	37.80748433213749
 I self served .	650.9490396904997
 WHEN THEY HAD LICKED the last of the wieners ' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette .	159.32151277662246
 Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad .	172.20866047091747
 How come you 're riding the rods , kids like you ?	469.2680625920994
 Ernie asked .	69.18132411294206
 Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply .	155.3202444988052
 But surprisingly , Kitty 's face came up and she said , My father .	251.16717471816992
 He did n't want us to get married .	265.7575015987363
 So we ran away .	303.9136295398443
 Why did n't he want you to get hitched ?	222.27799970810014
 This time even she did not answer .	286.0554444111669
 She looked down at her hands , too .	221.6783804976135
 After a few seconds , she said , Dad did n't like Cappy .	120.06746917749037
 It was my fault .	144.89807731273908
 Cappy 's head came around sharply .	289.9434295196657
 Your fault , hell !	2694.8339409802493
 It was all my fault .	169.96209277720496
 If I 'd been careful it never woulda- he stopped abruptly .	696.6175041835555
 Ernie 's eyebrows went up .	56.7475930771936
 What 's the matter ?	202.16043801717223
 The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , I 'm pregnant .	508.6974873037439
 Cappy raged at himself .	54.99416747387644
 Oh he was stupid , her old man !	559.5068998468631
 You never heard nothin ' like it Kitty 's gon na go have an abortion , and Kitty 's gon na go away to a convent , and Kitty 's this and Kitty 's that h like he was nuts or somethin ' , y'know ?	132.49525248189144
 Ernie nodded .	230.0743873165704
 This was a slightly different matter .	263.16593245226846
 He remembered Midge , and the child .	47.938236964778405
 But that had been a time before all this , a time he did n't think about .	174.77889125805933
 A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out .	178.93700029775695
 But these kids were n't like him .	255.52279397736123
 Oh crap !	306.4441174438153
 he thought , Pull out of it , old son .	160.2195811182113
 These are just another couple of characters to roll .	754.7602100890663
 What they got , you get .	219.1098662205586
 Now forget all this other .	615.7577307655315
 Wan na drink ?	237.6261400569869
 Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket .	219.59052044089577
 Yeah .	27.88141382290817
 Now that you offer .	308.2838125389098
 The answer came from the open door of the boxcar .	69.02957401704741
 From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade .	309.4645113873961
 Ernie stared at the man .	72.65659999653604
 He was big .	85.35430059792131
 Real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly .	274.9916969753851
 Road gang , Ernie thought .	613.2112778408595
 You gon na give me a drink , fella ?	184.73162813681833
 the big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar .	177.16718774519134
 Ernie hesitated a moment .	271.838118041184
 This character could break him in half .	374.17499170041526
 Sure , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips .	137.87031030259138
 He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder .	45.38063506274347
 The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring .	386.77367862155177
 He took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .	204.89713212272574
 He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously .	115.85954790064501
 He belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .	228.35999229338447
 Well , now , he said , and reached into his pocket .	114.22437621900384
 I did n't know I was gon na have company in this car .	197.1029220916965
 We 're going to Philadelphia , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more .	530.4804259144563
 No , I do n't think so , said the big man , and it was the final clincher for Ernie .	87.10599922557752
 He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it .	197.05442366233282
 Maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ai n't goin ' nowhere .	349.6882346420655
 He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car .	293.3944171883679
 Ernie was screaming inside himself No , damn you , you ai n't gon na take my meal ticket away from me !	989.3724851738368
 The newcomer stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth .	125.8013910948802
 Her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard .	241.3528578573215
 The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump !	300.1230319944605
 and carried him backward in a footballer 's tackle .	275.8598649377371
 They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs .	338.67891094445514
 The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back .	187.93084926726624
 The fist went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man 's deeper voice go , Aaawww !	376.38931693060437
 Then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade .	159.4911739432973
 He held the knife aloft an instant- an instant enough to press the stud .	396.94101578174383
 The blade came out with a snick !	151.35067952884512
 He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid 's throat .	126.75759314212661
 Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .	251.5345004052562
 She grabbed at Feathertop 's sleeve and shrieked , Help him !	73.78531097797702
 Help him !	90.6346773833211
 Do something !	1060.1359956667636
 They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man .	1895.0586019567645
 To them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after Mass , and at noon , and at six each evening- its tone , repetitive , monotonous , never breaking the boredom of the streets .	314.1949938211017
 The Old Man was unimportant .	548.6878049429965
 Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June ; or the smell of thick tomato paste- the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour- rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth .	307.48172429042427
 Or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights .	265.99538670256607
 Or the bay of female dogs in heat .	849.0386506160685
 They never called him by name , although he had one .	153.58589432568988
 Filippo Rossi , that 's what he was called in the old country ; but here he was just Signore or the Old Man .	145.93550804668493
 But this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders .	415.9186142584379
 Youth obeyed when commanded .	1231.6492388386669
 It went to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession .	621.6699581017124
 But youth asked nothing of its parents- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing .	187.04797658215543
 The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened .	644.7816818086237
 But the past was dead here as the present was dead .	154.36080342749256
 Once the Old Man had had a wife .	263.7340000308587
 And once she , too , ignored him .	199.99223643628517
 With a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders , she wiggled her satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and did n't stop .	268.06898138717696
 In one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase .	334.4093608762866
 The way she strutted down the street , the Old Man would have been blind not to have noticed both .	318.07925635347004
 Without looking at him , without looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars , rode away in it , and never came back .	508.99701170889153
 But she should n't have come here in the first place , the women had said .	131.27761230698994
 No , no .	261.22217005276974
 Not that one .	152.85942395453543
 She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from Torino .	356.302917718754
 Eh , Torino !	28.4857436946987
 She gave herself fancy airs !	1840.4374376184353
 Just because she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours .	359.4541475227349
 They had slapped their thighs .	32.54454366642296
 It 's not for making pretty speeches about Dante those actresses get paid so good .	593.4621793565784
 Henh !	68.18416038668607
 Calloused fingers , caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries , had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted , never to be tweezed away .	158.6898283042854
 Mauve-colored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man 's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again .	238.61396694356648
 Puttana !	68.11805146278638
 But if the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a fig .	761.663654606281
 It was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed- watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance , as thin as the seams on her stockings , and still thinner .	118.88487999652844
 His voice had not commanded her to stop .	392.6062795832528
 It had not questioned why .	238.295421938004
 The women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him .	509.8769638250838
 He was never without that dog .	209.93088035080166
 And his eyes- those miniature sundials of variegated yellow- had not altered their expression or direction .	235.18590617087673
 The Old Man 's very soul could have left him and flown down that street , but he would n't have had anyone know it .	228.90520927528414
 Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife .	645.5560396076354
 But when he called for his withered , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar ?	170.58218289672024
 There seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him .	381.9971087963468
 For all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in Italy , not the outskirts of Philadelphia .	171.8295679356284
 It could have been Bari or Chieti for the way it smelled .	107.87642291109627
 What did it matter to him that the park at the foot of Ash Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city 's center at half-hour intervals ?	609.8543199941533
 Or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the Schuylkill ?	1075.7326369029754
 This place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness .	193.00233353707088
 To him they were one and the same .	97.462593188338
 Sameness for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city .	361.6923185607643
 Sameness lined the streets with two-story houses the color of ash .	906.8339350848421
 It slashed the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches .	649.3718723778285
 It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors .	38.59773022506798
 Even the stable-garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it .	171.62904363503986
 And the coffee shop on Drexel Street , where the men spent their evenings and Sundays playing cards , had a rose hedge beneath its window .	924.541229449024
 The hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it .	119.76535344526243
 Only one house on the street had no lawn before it .	282.88913231366917
 It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade .	555.4924975207215
 That was Bartoli 's shop .	76.81131843242837
 Above it , from a second-story showroom , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood .	272.0618864029244
 Did the Old Man remember them there ?	2077.8427432402423
 Yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks- like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery .	168.41451993787152
 Only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences , where one man 's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy .	223.39751909966014
 Love and hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by fig trees and grape vines .	361.1046703453606
 And the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch .	1285.9415548425668
 The Old Man silently fed upon these streets .	2030.836148376142
 They kept him alive , waiting .	404.0529853429843
 Waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not .	374.4736005105164
 It was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price .	115.89107704837464
 He was holding out for something .	143.81176605224178
 He was determined to hold out .	78.31002866883885
 2 The Old Man 's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich .	308.2536078978406
 At fifteen he did n't care that he had no mother , that he could n't remember her face or her touch ; neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him .	483.86595390664155
 He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have cared less about that either .	244.3727541060848
 To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .	649.3916484565566
 When he would be a man , he would be a rich man .	65.98410046387654
 He would not be like the rich Americans who lived in white-columned houses on the other side of the park .	152.1798261827577
 He would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning .	210.03720862523394
 He would not carry a brief case .	141.69724678125115
 Nor would he work at all .	217.43094861356028
 He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step .	543.1448299398775
 He would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , bowing with her running , calling out in her bowing , At your service .	318.788232358865
 He would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff- he would not remove his gloves- and light and smoke .	310.3756934756158
 He could do that when he would be a man .	62.050628522938624
 Hey , Laura !	222.07048986612003
 he called to his sister on the porch above the steps .	309.98550992519307
 She was only ten months older than he .	499.8006549076489
 Laura , what would you say if I smoked a pipe ?	369.3808728312107
 Laura did not answer him .	310.19308026981275
 She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , gilded hair in the sun .	661.1328317351298
 One lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking , torn pales .	158.49940510694645
 Her tanned foot , whose arch swept high and white , pointed artfully toward tapering toes- toes like fingers , whose tips glowed white .	722.1154101875424
 All the while she sat there , her sinewy arms swirled before her chest .	398.2326863435219
 Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii .	514.3165624284845
 It was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours .	218.59048162762977
 The eyes , blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality .	211.62980319620706
 Even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance .	153.81413569180918
 He was never sure they fully took him in .	360.93398628341373
 Pompeii called again , Laura !	388.0322253314191
 But the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it .	307.1750176778629
 She 's in a mood , he thought There 's not a month she does n't get herself in a mood .	345.59514461205123
 Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ?	515.8564779597289
 And as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him .	224.64834346466606
 Not even Laura .	845.0223846695369
 Suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat 's claret tongue , feasting against the salt taste of him .	135.2920683531498
 Above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , sallow and time-cast , encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin , stared unfalteringly at him .	271.30763965481646
 Christ sake , goat , git !	187.37813727873197
 But the goat would not .	37.58720696286164
 You 're boiling milk , ai n't you ?	1971.0237210087344
 soothing it with his hand , knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch .	42.11581479253494
 Pompeii rolled over .	464.38073413143115
 His head undulated gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats .	289.17516752426974
 With his mouth opened wide , he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light , earthy taste of it .	345.53706743768896
 The boy 's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did .	315.3418866682147
 Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud .	219.8563847547256
 Its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane .	87.26191895482891
 But the boy could see only the goat 's belly .	143.22909635742604
 The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it .	532.8907401535167
 He knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he would n't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog 's back .	325.57230881426665
 There would be time enough , perhaps the Old Man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due .	317.84548910218547
 Time enough to give up his soul .	505.4455171809992
 In the meantime , six sandals , stained an ocher , the same color as Pompeii 's shaved hair , edged up close to him .	167.62510166539997
 The clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks .	116.68107921676221
 He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to Niobe , the neatest ones to Concetta , and the laced ones to Romeo , Concetta 's idiot brother .	69.93461334555188
 Pompeii expected Romeo 's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground .	289.6826875046883
 He expected Concetta 's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything .	186.8358608621507
 People came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it .	480.2221195332952
 The room filled with smoke , and Maggie 's head throbbed with excitement and fatigue , but Stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that Maggie could n't bear to do anything to quench it .	316.12701572156016
 Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery .	1412.3929394732354
 In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head .	358.1023972475762
 She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her .	726.4173150045879
 She was so heavy that Maggie 's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her .	602.1046649609015
 Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .	247.23514520042704
 Worry had a great deal to do with it ; Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father 's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him .	271.25058821017626
 Mr Clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife 's people without contributing to his and his family 's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap .	572.4795986140183
 Maggie and Stuart pored over figures every night , trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more .	453.04968042597613
 In desperation Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon Do you think you could find me something I could do here at home to make some money , so I could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things ?	539.6945528240686
 It seems to me you have enough to do as it is , Eugenia said .	135.24649309392746
 She had been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again .	232.15687407037862
 I have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing something , Maggie said .	335.07760510817315
 It would make me feel a lot better , but the Woman 's Exchange is n't taking baked goods any more and I ca n't leave the baby with Grandma because she is n't strong enough and the baby 's too young to be put in a nursery .	480.25359487055067
 I should think so , Eugenia said .	114.67472697112291
 For one thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day .	748.632644998651
 She 's so beautiful , and I do like to keep her looking nice .	385.23519115258904
 Maggie said .	35.731690454216874
 She picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck .	766.8773609561176
 She 'll be just as beautiful in something that does n't have to be ironed , Eugenia said .	168.08756331608538
 Evadna Mae Evans said she did n't put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old .	230.50800614716002
 Evadna Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from Best 's Liliputian Bazaar in New York , and I 'm sick and tired of hearing about Evadna Mae Evans .	265.7048587314496
 Well now , Maggie , you do n't have to snap at me , Eugenia said .	80.31603346336277
 I 'm just thinking of a way for you to be sensible .	273.011711086112
 I 'm sorry .	779.1333427170514
 I do seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think of a way to make a little extra money .	201.70937574977955
 Well , let 's see .	254.8589797256344
 Let 's make a list of your assets .	338.3888302800187
 Maggie started laughing , and she laughed so hard she could n't stop , and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining .	509.75753981314733
 When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures .	337.2284931195482
 I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers , Eugenia said .	322.8937995577615
 We could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it 's nice and sunny , but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that .	368.4839782327974
 What else ?	465.86642194651967
 You might set up a dress shop in the living room .	354.0130443875436
 Every woman in the block has tried that .	390.4133502579581
 What about a tea room , then ?	272.76178253762356
 You could set up tables in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread and Grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes .	524.9645692594314
 It 's too elaborate .	290.8676659016413
 And Grandma is n't strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am I .	315.5614388358486
 Eugenia sighed .	324.55765897944093
 She said , Well , those are the really interesting things , but if you do n't like any of those I can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough .	379.20882000907176
 Oh , I 'm sure I could do that , Maggie said .	206.88199426272303
 But it really would n't be fair , taking your jobs away from you .	372.68302777628725
 Do n't worry , I can get plenty more , Eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could .	406.0860947350285
 Maggie was looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be brushing up on her typing so Eugenia would n't be ashamed of it .	214.86234761497258
 And then whenever I have a minute I can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time .	210.1055151345269
 And I can go back to my contests and be thinking while I 'm doing the washing .	422.4015862729817
 What are you going to do with your feet so you do n't waste anything ?	768.7904220202312
 Maggie laughed .	144.28815712821887
 She said , Oh Eugenia , I wish h What ?	333.6731827752037
 I wish I had three wishes , Maggie said .	228.12209728634807
 All of them for you .	183.52284286378057
 It grew bitterly cold toward the end of November , contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people .	312.65885266101617
 The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days .	465.8297526316229
 The cold settled like a tangible pall over the Mile High City , locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance ; it had a look of grim stark realism , resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold , instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy Western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources .	409.24179560417934
 The jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies .	840.7433301086139
 There were n't facilities to take care of them ; there never had been a need felt for such facilities .	275.637108516958
 That kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight rates .	289.5189307022998
 The East was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay .	627.8605714287614
 The government offices were being opened but they were n't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything .	1184.9628270528885
 Shivering , people talked and argued ; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate remedies and something had to be done .	487.77062566938065
 Something had to be done ; it was the theme song of millions of American people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government .	374.66885804963874
 Something had to be done .	174.60080652382567
 The Abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day .	228.48975163838054
 Something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half soles , for overshoes , for clothes , for the new leaks in the roof , for gas and light bills ; about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once , twice , fifty times a day .	352.0304530093494
 Just dropping the baby 's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster .	830.8608578907832
 The Abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold .	530.7663007393558
 Cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up , under doors , around loosened window frames , from the sleeping porches , the attic , from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof .	171.68032908737717
 Presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the fireplaces and an electric heater in Grandma 's room .	306.18471709607746
 It was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them , like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive .	269.64512234297007
 The pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms .	434.2904208300261
 They lived mainly in the kitchen ; they moved Maggie 's bed and the baby 's basket there , and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds .	306.118279073932
 Grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to .	301.03392172315165
 You said a mouthful , Eugenia said grimly .	46.71969321536721
 Eugenia hated being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin .	812.2445439108268
 She said to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever .	164.31641700481828
 Plenty of people are poor all their lives .	318.1586842409964
 Plenty of people have n't our brains and talent .	395.6419349174167
 I know you when you start talking about brains and talent , Maggie said .	509.11662797173915
 You 're working up to something , and if you do n't watch out you 'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the Abernathy family is superior to everything , even a depression .	457.64312578447397
 The only thing that worries me is how I 'm going to prove it , Eugenia said .	364.3825346726339
 They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way .	310.9220199058763
 She did n't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater .	456.0638248640559
 Hope would n't hear of it , and she took the heater back to Grandma 's room , and Grandma took it back to Hope 's room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire .	200.16910877398806
 She said that proved she was n't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it .	292.79873374400535
 Eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma would n't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in .	505.5428127006854
 Thrifty of her to use it up .	112.58912714630885
 Unusual in a case like this , but- You can joke !	300.83487181692374
 Did n't you read it ?	863.6263611017755
 She 's married that tenant !	220.4376686514317
 I read it , yes .	161.9690674454709
 This ought to simplify Tolley 's life .	259.27751727787063
 Laban had more to say .	73.31064141093715
 Tolley had gone to live in California .	158.16376819367014
 He 'd mentioned it , himself , at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that Tolley had left because Jenny had jilted him for Roy robards .	178.81018299095203
 It was plain as the nose on your face that they 're laughing about it , Mamma .	415.2817846021945
 Zion stayed to get my pin , but it 'll be a cold day in June when I go back .	278.1992104282129
 We will both go back , Laban !	210.11430048091327
 Kizzie turned to go inside .	173.934446062764
 Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , Mamma .	912.4560261915514
 The sun 's right- Pictures ?	70.36668388721978
 She swung around .	751.8389885994552
 What pictures ?	972.4039507458245
 In Brace 's room !	134.21581566504088
 You told me to bring my camera .	469.77872628296535
 I 'm not going back- Indeed you are !	789.1659005468157
 Why should I want pictures of an empty room now ?	922.1033546050636
 Tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little Jenny !	69.43356362250144
 This- trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants , and I am going to see that everybody at Mt Pleasant understands that simple fact .	225.38894049322045
 Wait for me , Laban , I 'll be dressed in half a second !	355.48626032413006
 Frank followed her into the bedroom , hooked her dress up the back .	397.2092704098187
 Hurry , Frank !	198.58702941670643
 They 're not going to laugh at the Fairbrothers and Labans very long !	194.56429930292038
 Tolley 's going is my fault .	302.55272815636414
 I drove him away .	175.8498795149992
 You know it and I 'll tell everybody exactly how it happened .	661.4033580400795
 She was so beautiful , so valiant , so pitiable .	78.34860624459269
 He kissed her .	57.90231127033859
 Make your confession to God , Kizzie dear , not to the congregation .	410.3421091652942
 I 'll decide that when I get there .	283.9999780817433
 I was so cruel to Tolley , so unfair .	161.62952071948993
 But I 'll be fair now !	366.95834020107316
 He is coming back , is n't he , Frank ?	195.44165599747132
 Yes , oh yes .	974.1142205712868
 What else was there to say ?	190.70129474832888
 Returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from Jonathan Swift on his lips Under the window in stormy weather I marry this man and woman together .	484.69851543412597
 Let none but Him who rules the thunder Put this man and woman asunder .	1245.283876321996
 Absolution for his lie ?	214.61985268703432
 He questioned God 's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about Kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole , wondering why he had preserved it .	294.1984897687623
 If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it .	391.8522499589268
 In any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons , making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own .	418.4179246101715
 It was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing .	348.0154703678903
 You 've told God , Frank , he said .	296.04970776786837
 Why lacerate the- congregation ?	424.6036949901963
 Reaching for an old clay pot , relic of pioneer days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little pyre to flame , watching it curl , the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash .	386.16424344845706
 Surely now his beloved son could rest in peace .	588.4649579817099
 'And let me go , for the night gathers me , and in the night shall no man gather fruit ' .	305.24614599791687
 A beautiful and haunting line , a subtle genius , Swinburne , difficult not to envy a gifted man , and perhaps he did h. But there were great satisfactions , even for a small man .	202.16066486442242
 Beyond his window were the greening trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal life .	568.5815032791647
 There lay Grand Fair 's Quinzaine , his own young parents ' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , grandsons .	317.40029903930775
 He poured his thimble of wine for the toast he 'd made so often .	320.7481379959181
 To absent loved ones .	2037.2044843307667
 But this last time he drank not to Brace but To Tolley !	216.8931218110925
 42 MR ROBARDS- Jenny was the only person she knew of in the Mt Pleasant neighborhood who called him that- was kind but too easygoing .	439.9400744625515
 It did n't bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say , Howdy , Miss Jenny , adding a careless Roy , but it did her .	171.98336290228474
 He could put a stop to it , she told him again and again .	161.97756174874692
 Simply call Mr Whipsnade Oscar , and Dr Dunne PG , and C'un Major Frank .	194.1380515957337
 Mr Robards laughed , said he 'd feel a damn fool , plain-out could n't do that even to please her .	443.8558698940306
 You could try .	304.85700477499677
 And if I ever hear you say 'Mist Laban ' again I 'll scream .	541.5916643221749
 And do n't tell me you did n't at church Sunday .	546.4469068085662
 I heard you !	319.24760690969947
 He really had n't meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr Robards .	197.36382572322023
 How strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in- spiritual ways .	427.73641088176976
 Another weakness- far more irritating than his manner of speaking , which he made only token effort to change- was his devotion to that old horse of Tolley 's .	283.3025127819101
 Her horse , rather .	589.4876106991665
 But Mr Robards ' now , oh my yes , indeed , yes !	468.8909606579531
 He called her the Mare much as Mrs Whipsnade spoke of the Queen , God bless her .	357.75103051018607
 h He , with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there in the barn , was reverent only of the Mare , the Racin ' Mare , the revolting Gunny .	87.27488152709078
 For the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny , going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall .	328.69719426866504
 And what had happened ?	210.1552133512839
 Gunny invariably tried to bite her .	685.299985838492
 Nerves , Mr Robards said , just a nip anyway .	78.51391093255678
 Stand back , Miss Jen , she 's oneasy of your scarf .	58.711789851622534
 Never , Quit that , you sor'l devil !	267.2279529498242
 Never concern for his wife 's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January .	816.7563447878663
 She mus n't annoy Gunny whose foal was due then too !	210.4008469515292
 Listening for hours to his laments that the war and Mist Fair 's poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph , and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come , Jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it .	288.01230922235027
 Gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant- Tolley , the indifference with which the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her disgusting swollen stomach .	328.84845849420026
 Human birth was no novelty to Mr Robards .	535.5325320304727
 Tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick , he suggested .	150.04431832555048
 Jenny 's aversion to having Dr Dunne , a former admirer , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her .	268.51056973980656
 The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure .	358.71592476220724
 He would be in the barn , or riding for the veterinarian !	87.77417878906759
 Night after night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter , rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment , fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe , tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house .	231.4348747729034
 Yet when the dear baby came , he had Tillie over here in a jiffy , and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been .	182.75087822711308
 Jenny wished now that she had had Dr Dunne , feeling that somehow he would n't have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets .	307.10368000041115
 There was something not nice about triplets , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they had n't been the son he wanted , saying , You do n't see triplets trippin ' down the pike ever ' day , Miss Jen , hon .	249.72625897748583
 Rhyme 'em up cute- Arcilla , Flotilla h Edmonia for her mother , she said firmly , Jennifer , for herself , and- Kezziah , for Miss Kizzie , he suggested .	136.91305197935122
 She was mighty good to you past times , an ' this 'll fetch her .	645.9213166666048
 Now she must be thinking of a boy-name , something special .	168.06084106851648
 Just wait till she saw the Mare 's foal .	238.20586062013015
 Handsomest colt in all Kentucky .	381.95977439909285
 Strong too , up on his legs when he was an hour old .	386.99385635547156
 What about Royal Robards ?	438.37094477501324
 Why do n't you name him Jesus Christ !	1486.5976191660875
 She burst into tears .	1357.2075406518577
 Roy was deeply distressed .	351.25860050554195
 He 'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been .	367.18869962721766
 Of course she was n't herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits did n't seem to rise with it .	502.6487668950333
 He had a good idea why not .	181.28949557320405
 Those elegant At Home cards she sent out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all trimmed up , had n't brought many callers in two whole months .	649.5636086000907
 Doc Dunne and Miss Sis had come .	62.90908487390471
 So had Miss Shawnee Rakestraw , full of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his Heavenly Rest last year , saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town in inclement weather , was looking forward to Quinzaine Spa this summer .	414.7932675821488
 There was an idea .	69.73602663933251
 Miss Kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married , though you 'd have thought a namesake would have brought her round .	341.7103543678572
 Oh , she 'd come to see them once , left silver teething rings for all of the trips .	244.18526657896177
 But when Miss Jen went over right away to return the call , Miss Kiz could n't have been very cordial , for she 'd come back before she hardly had time to get there .	386.6736767668597
 More and more , these days , she 'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to Tillie 's and Nick's- his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and pups under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies .	493.14725269538116
 Though he was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too .	330.43507858958395
 It made him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea Miss Sis had given him , to be told by Miss Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain Mrs Robards and the children .	261.07962681167857
 She hoped they were well .	338.7360794641212
 He did n't tell Miss Jen , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those Quinzaine nigs , and she really took a fit .	275.54555241944007
 If he ever did such a thing again she 'd die of shame .	656.9573486627839
 Have a party an ' leave 'em out , hon , he suggested .	465.68511318856474
 A swell party , send an invite to ever'body but them- those folks you met at the Galt House , the ones I 've got to know in this new Jockey Club affair , the whole dang neighborhood .	427.4554789177534
 We 'll have oystchers- couple bar'l oystchers 'll fetch in a crowd any time .	235.82412297124165
 I 'll see word gets round .	1229.1223652186834
 Do n't you dare !	1296.631063231593
 Miss Jen was funny that way , funny that she did n't seem to take to his ideas and perk up .	250.4998869974294
 He was downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try h. Zion was surprised when Roy 's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town .	579.002007911204
 Roy smiled- he did have a nice smile- took off his hat most politely , told her to hop in , and he 'd give her a lift to Quinzaine .	287.88775911252753
 Her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he did n't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on .	614.407453848933
 See for yourself , Miss Zion .	350.03045656082736
 It wo n't take a minute .	320.48431655212846
 He swung in through his own wide gateway .	206.81746652692019
 Them 's the purtiest babes you ever did see , but Miss Jen gets mighty lonesome .	180.05008456226847
 She 'll relish the sight of a friendly face .	490.59110371926846
 Miss Kiz wo n't care your comin ' , will she ?	615.1427265007993
 Why of course not , Zion said uncomfortably .	141.0245241204301
 He must have forgiven me , Henrietta murmured to the room .	426.350944097262
 The absolution of Doaty 's last will and testament was proof enough of that ; Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman .	190.7028080287724
 She found herself wishing an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin .	481.5471690227747
 Perhaps Doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel .	288.925287990897
 Henrietta thought , It 's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us .	703.2495149052469
 There had been more to know about Hetty , inevitably , and most of it unfavorable .	95.16452720223542
 Adelia was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted .	181.56361152571148
 Their childhood would have been quite circumspect without Hetty 's flair for drama , especially through the long summers .	371.06986231713523
 In winter , in the city , there had been the Maneret School , which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge ; there had been lessons in French from a small Polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; there had been the dancing class- Miss Craddock , thin and tireless , with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three , one-two-three .	216.26494214967545
 There had been supper parties and teas , fetes and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the Blackwell planets revolved .	309.2228534044273
 Mama had died before the corruption of the family circle , the interruption of Charles .	381.58154705881816
 It was safe to assume that Papa , sighing heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , Thank God your poor mother was spared this , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in Charles ' hand , just because her poor mother was gone already and would never know .	422.96520434410996
 Mama was vulnerable ; one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her .	465.90325410634074
 But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta .	603.4954427242935
 She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .	255.3936157203522
 Only at this moment- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty 's bed- she found herself examining how others might regard her .	658.8858856365651
 Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice .	576.3296930639765
 She turned on her side , finding the idea oppressive .	224.78754438407796
 If Adelia had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run away with him ?	471.4551467364897
 Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone .	341.0067181983598
 No temptation , no sin .	407.0363920889576
 No temptation , no virtue ?	644.7482993204167
 A curious thought to end a curious night .	578.6953831422086
 The birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all of Doaty 's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf .	345.72030845332966
 Before anything else , she would go to Doaty 's grave with flowers from Doaty 's forgotten garden .	382.51110000152875
 Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards .	662.7418006787195
 She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls .	1297.6381300241314
 It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray .	203.99651104522596
 After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .	479.6866989778802
 The garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness .	141.30630515440515
 Leaning out , she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it .	140.40858714927577
 On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song .	372.0220953077457
 It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age .	296.9008955497153
 Feeling suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs .	420.4894404756946
 Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human .	116.50252999237915
 Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .	348.3824401673125
 Outside , the garden , the tame wilderness , yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies , sweet william , scented stock and lady 's bedstraw , which she tied with long grasses and took back to show Rosa , who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing Folly .	134.9460339628748
 The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws .	66.24470222035534
 Henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for Doaty .	250.9159340606722
 Rummaging in the dew , said Rosa coldly .	20.955779927621315
 Go change your shoes before you turn around .	2043.1644673168616
 She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home .	886.140642947647
 Folly danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door .	541.9551673897613
 To a Blackwell , there was only one church .	70.53286365318804
 The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea .	163.9843351552865
 For the first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity .	412.16852631090563
 She smiled and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child .	511.05139086556346
 Now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested .	117.46205484630751
 An old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than reflective look as she passed , the sap still plainly rising in his branches .	368.5696233077688
 On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning .	432.0272820396719
 He cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition , announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time .	188.9362203679144
 He then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was unenthusiastic .	106.8566450803303
 Summer 's been slow to come , he said .	114.78727037431128
 It 's my dryin ' out time .	158.21923909003607
 He scowled at her flowers .	96.67586886796605
 I 'm taking them to the cemetery , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality .	359.44511603999746
 They 'll be takin ' me next , he said pleasantly , but not so soon 's they plan .	326.8452081281384
 See half of 'em in their graves before I choose my own coffin .	316.85071478210085
 It 's dryin ' myself out that does it .	149.51616599962662
 He regarded her with rising hope .	532.1439270682253
 You 'd like to hear how I go about it .	402.78444428933295
 It 's nice of you , Henrietta said doubtfully .	219.93857270248833
 Y 're welcome .	3713.6570935572863
 He straightened himself , soldierly against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots .	382.14114456147814
 His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text .	254.77117623787538
 Every month , f'r three days , he said happily , I take no water into my system , no water whatsoever .	226.25528491530187
 It rests the tissues .	377.5249690127043
 Henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense .	667.46088205799
 Rests the tissues , he said , and pacifies the system .	53.306745233611004
 My dad did it , and he lived to a great age .	84.52957337721107
 He looked up at her sharply .	179.86680006238836
 Do n't remember , do you ?	450.99315750441144
 She did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old Titus , who must have been in his nineties when Henrietta ran away .	191.75998365427
 Next to the Blackwells , Titus had owned the island most , and she and Adelia had often stood in front of him , silenced by his terrible years- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner , more aged than possible .	218.47472870883794
 He had never spoken once to the awed sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea .	231.01339699147823
 It must be that son who sat before her now , shriveled to half his size and half his senses .	296.8380347047354
 She said gently , Of course I remember you .	800.3507599423283
 Not so well 's I remember you , he said .	249.61851919756634
 Y 're the young Blackwell woman .	601.251392664151
 Ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man .	94.31942151363566
 I know all about you .	159.35289713969198
 You do seem to , said Henrietta , impressed .	583.9455370124693
 Ca n't blame a man for leavin ' his wife , he said quite cheerfully .	167.81448131454982
 Left mine many a time , only she never knew it .	517.3889186454669
 Man in a boat , there 's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit .	273.05563973372404
 Any harm in that ?	953.6182164504511
 Probably , said Henrietta dryly .	365.3233719993357
 He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly .	264.6026747364584
 You 'd be the one to say , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were different , since all actions had their own laws .	454.5704433916726
 Only , this old man 's connivance was even less to her taste than Selma Cotter 's open censure .	192.60937382540712
 Well , she had not come back to Great Island to be understood , praised or condemned .	346.21358559388557
 She had come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow .	182.36884851198988
 She started to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a big-boned , drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress .	244.61204960986697
 She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man .	618.6098819305765
 You 've not had your breakfast yet , gran'dad .	405.741398104978
 Y'r dam ' porridge is no breakfast , he said .	185.15436944958697
 Milk and sops !	502.508126373525
 He beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones .	102.26848417021692
 He 's owly today , his grand-daughter said wearily , and bent to pick it up .	91.36586364550878
 He 's got this idea about drying out h It ai n't an idea !	1028.6926086017882
 If it ai n't an idea , she said , how comes it you can drink beer but not water ?	571.9528162405301
 He looked piously to heaven and said , Beer do n't affect the tissues none , and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence .	344.6733947585579
 His grand-daughter sighed .	224.99445278648017
 Come on , do .	904.9005243053324
 The children are eating , and Miss Blackwell 's on her way somewheres .	156.62030504020527
 To the graveyard .	142.3422316723757
 Who ai n't ?	2793.0836425091793
 Not me .	212.62152151040578
 I 've got a day 's work to do.- You 'll be visiting Miss Doaty , ma'am ?	309.1433946604812
 Henrietta nodded .	5695.434646946697
 How much they knew about her !	546.5099038127529
 The woman she must have been a tiny baby when Hetty and Delia had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small answered the nod with her own .	779.8409857993865
 God rest her soul , she was a sweet one .	537.3406542121751
 Come on now .	862.7920084116702
 She put a strong hand under the old man 's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old .	413.3727031007082
 He mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength .	387.2264640193395
 There was a gabble of voices from indoors , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of swearing from the old man .	310.4606904612315
 Henrietta looked down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on their journey 's way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , Folly dancing ahead of her .	380.1861791749081
 At the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , dotted with fat round bushes like sheep .	610.5158961256438
 They were covered with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots clawing at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry .	291.4570020210516
 The air was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky .	270.4303012645537
 She felt mindless , walking , and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty .	412.385600265164
 Both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them how many things had lessened while she was gone away but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named Dorothy Tredding seemed suddenly impossible .	775.6110259923306
 She sat down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with sea-damp , her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss .	439.3205374273192
 The day 's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her parasol , if only to shade Doaty 's flowers .	379.3859406208555
 A small , rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery .	460.64477124307604
 She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts .	368.5144309553268
 The Momoyama family had come from Miyagi Prefecture , in the northeast of the main Japanese island of Honshu , where there are still traces of the mysterious Ainu strain .	160.95407886863478
 The Ainus were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal ancestors of the Japanese came from Southern Asia .	219.16875830504185
 Apparently they were of Caucasian blood .	211.35607030826847
 They had white skins and blue eyes ; all their men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful .	508.226337972364
 A pitiful few of them are left now , to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants , which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the American Indians .	162.55014921928685
 Most of them have been assimilated , but sometimes a man in Miyagi or Akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average Japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the South .	170.4835983140296
 Tommy Momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions .	535.8290428577809
 She was taller than most Japanese girls , and had the exquisitely willowy form of the Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall .	223.4581102311615
 Her nose was higher of bridge , her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn , and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong .	380.7863254638798
 Her mouth , soft and full , was something for any man to dream about .	522.0734043084017
 She had black eyes , long and intriguingly tilted , and the way she walked was melody .	356.0381615631562
 She had been in Japan just one week .	372.45180429614527
 It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at San Diego , Bremerton , the Great Lakes , Pensacola- any place the Navy had a hospital- with a threat to resign her commission if the	342.6686843422473
371.1640456588943
