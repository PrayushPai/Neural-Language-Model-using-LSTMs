 Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous <unk> , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and <unk> .	450.25417787510463
 Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week .	599.2398368944054

 Daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help <unk> an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug 31 .	1564.0491198447712
 He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the <unk> law which has been on the books since Texas was a republic .	517.4910346101768
 It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more .	801.9747275944729

 When the shouting ended , the bill passed , <unk> to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen George Parkhouse of Dallas .	499.6453132819995
 Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen Parkhouse .	1200.9039606047802
 The bill would increase from <unk> to <unk> the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project .	256.2041002260004
 Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas .	2814.192175025588
 <unk> by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten 's attack .	1013.8761825987899
 The bill 's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J W <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> de la <unk> of Mission , Sam F Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of <unk> Springs .	988.9047843589244

 MUST <unk> PROBLEM The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is <unk> million dollars , said C <unk> Martin , president of <unk> <unk> Scott Co , committee chairman .	1018.9607160755023
 We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence , Martin said .	982.7660142365131
 The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems <unk> limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color .	723.4165713788306
 These , he said , are two of the principal underlying causes for family <unk> leading to ADC .	334.9547267636252
 <unk> FOR <unk> Other recommendations made by the committee are <unk> of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity .	468.9586646203703
 Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of <unk> and illegitimacy .	390.8695181751511
 Several defendants in the <unk> police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday .	1635.8040578136988
 The <unk> by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , <unk> observers and was viewed as the <unk> to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial .	741.105552731819
 Bellows made the <unk> when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan <unk> , 30 , a separate trial .	515.4224614315636
 Bellows made the request while the <unk> jury was out of the <unk> .	160.65588274351305
 <unk> <unk> <unk> The statements may be highly <unk> to my client , Bellows told the court .	254.4372270360094
 Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property .	1214.5697705629364
 It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others .	428.09855432647777
 Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this ?	2220.659331216384
 Yes , your honor , replied Bellows .	909.1622202058145
 What this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a <unk> fight in this case .	157.81078497933285
 There is a conflict among the defendants .	195.7785684854438
 WASHINGTON , <unk> 24 - President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio .	1543.503453927645
 The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first <unk> of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone .	642.5942140643963
 Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in <unk> from <unk> Port , Mass , a White House spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion .	820.6055965056299
 <unk> ARE <unk> Asked to elaborate , Pierre Salinger , White House press secretary , replied , I would say it 's got to go thru several more <unk> .	889.0128225542096
 Salinger said the work President Kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia 's demands and proposals for the city .	981.6425965398552
 The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M Karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means .	1588.2689367151222
 Karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the 50 persons .	473.2658465320521
 He said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens .	330.7048736820601
 Karns ' ruling <unk> to eight of the 10 cases .	527.7110557314855
 In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case .	168.7905148893339
 <unk> proceedings originally had been brought against <unk> persons in 133 precincts by Morris J Wexler , special <unk> .	1278.7958015686224
 ISSUE <unk> <unk> Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury <unk> to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury .	839.9589891572085
 Mayer Goldberg , attorney for election judges in the <unk> precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation .	1672.1321265087308
 Wexler has denied repeatedly that <unk> was used in questioning .	631.1177075884582
 Karns said it was a <unk> act for Wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room .	680.9272419268502
 He said this constituted a very serious misuse of the Criminal court processes .	727.7115101239025
 Actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county , <unk> <unk> of the authority of that court is not the function of this court , said Karns , who is a City judge in East St Louis sitting in Cook County court .	469.68867711777403
 <unk> <unk> <unk> Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons .	960.1968387030215
 Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary <unk> of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another .	483.52448348699795
 The cases involved judges in the <unk> , 24th , and <unk> precincts of the <unk> ward , the <unk> and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward .	385.07898056522663
 The case of the judges in the <unk> precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under <unk> by Karns .	290.91645195511387
 Two other cases also were under <unk> .	379.64002179545207
 <unk> <unk> <unk> After reading his statement <unk> the 23d ward case , Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been <unk> , he would dismiss them .	673.712315974511
 WASHINGTON , FEB 9 - President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of <unk> million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs .	2543.104825047333
 The President , in a special message to Congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research .	1522.198861470486
 The aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol hill .	931.50038680423
 It was defeated in Congress last year .	488.9861318999153
 COST UP TO 37 A YEAR It would be financed by <unk> the social security payroll tax by as much as 37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes .	1605.8407471574446
 The social security payroll tax is now 6 per <unk> 3 per cent on each worker and <unk> on the first <unk> of pay per year .	376.9476365357894
 The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to 5,000 a year and the payroll tax to <unk> per <unk> <unk> per cent each .	448.77955356005134
 Similar payroll tax <unk> would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system .	744.9179953099429
 The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs .	827.9780205486829
 <unk> WOULD <unk> Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 .	973.3654662388767
 Both figures would go higher in later years .	653.6510340257662
 Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would <unk> federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years .	996.0776494313312
 These would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes .	294.31245537887844
 <unk> HOME <unk> The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 1 .	1729.4832802837327
 Full payment of hospital bills for <unk> up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay 10 a day of the cost for the first nine days .	422.01457893969865
 2 .	165.55405566295536
 Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital .	2133.2115151379694
 A patient could receive up to 300 days <unk> nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the <unk> credit .	807.8955969389511
 3 .	207.64857838636595
 Hospital <unk> <unk> diagnostic service for all costs in excess of 20 a patient .	642.7018218594546
 4 .	240.05462567717535
 Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness .	2694.0074810647184
 The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged .	1672.2017892687784
 <unk> <unk> <unk> He said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers ' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their <unk> or those of their <unk> caused by an extended hospital stay .	407.1808434739813
 This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs , he said , and with sufficient <unk> ' requirements to discourage any <unk> or unnecessary <unk> of our hospitals .	458.47354735829924
 This is not a program of <unk> medicine .	92.56847292820825
 It is a program of <unk> of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed .	387.0821268151422
 Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital .	861.5800865642676
 WOULD N'T <unk> <unk> The plan does not cover doctor bills .	1725.128806315257
 They would still be paid by the patient .	143.2598781952098
 Apart from the aged care plan the President 's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools .	1301.1462555047283
 The President said the nation 's <unk> medical and 47 dental schools can not now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care .	860.7857395168079
 Moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and <unk> because they ca n't afford the schooling costs .	540.4831920780084
 <unk> TO <unk> The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to 1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students .	760.666662054688
 The schools could use the money to pay <unk> scholarships , based on need , of up to 2,000 a year per student .	428.6515724096786
 In addition , the government would pay a 1,000 cost of education grant to the schools for each 1,500 in scholarship grants .	494.251125873933
 Officials estimated the combined programs would cost <unk> million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 .	940.7161403324359
 The President recommended federal matching grants totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or <unk> the capacity of existing ones .	2014.978761246887
 MORE FOR <unk> <unk> In the area of community health services , the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction .	1244.727919422024
 He asked for another 10 million dollar initial appropriation for <unk> grants to states to improve nursing homes .	1589.339863326833
 He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals .	1747.411016791984
 In the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children 's bureau .	519.6241096001271
 He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute .	1156.3901681650052
 <unk> RESEARCH FUNDS The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation .	1318.3290280137066
 He did not say by how much .	144.60090105365225
 For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities .	1261.8483482787628
 The President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the <unk> million dollars in the <unk> budget for direct government research in medicine .	494.7989025531416
 The President said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them .	462.2473906193144
 REACTION AS EXPECTED Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines .	2406.183901530513
 <unk> who last year opposed placing <unk> under the social security system criticized the President 's plan .	791.20055772374
 Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message .	2030.3905442885393
 Senate Republican Leader <unk> Ill and House Republican Leader Charles <unk> <unk> said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance .	1950.5670670332465
 <unk> said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first .	1167.380099558335
 House Speaker Sam Rayburn D , Tex called the Kennedy program a mighty fine thing , but made no prediction on its fate in the House .	1084.2407006025664
 WASHINGTON , FEB 9 - Acting hastily under White House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C Weaver as the nation 's federal housing chief .	4113.407087017916
 Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote .	603.711848253487
 A number of scattered <unk> and <unk> was heard .	80.37078320814985
 <unk> Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency .	836.4839482468375
 In the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor .	910.8274964438851
 <unk> BY DEMAND The rule was enforced by demand of Sen Wayne Morse D , <unk> in connection with President Eisenhower 's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy 's in 1961 .	1743.4749920651652
 <unk> The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign <unk> has been the freer , <unk> , and wider discussions , <unk> by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings .	823.1911805127061
 This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes .	597.2522371533086
 In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of <unk> , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems .	306.35792428428596
 This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the <unk> powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems .	381.6271799043455
 The <unk> of a <unk> between those in trouble in Africa , <unk> by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally <unk> of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been <unk> by its absence .	241.24247278356333
 <unk> <unk> In the case of <unk> , which a few weeks ago was <unk> ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its <unk> policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension .	323.28843105960823
 The general , remarkably <unk> , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council .	398.36196908574436
 There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad <unk> NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as <unk> will be discussed in advance .	666.2863817611046
 Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO <unk> .	522.7746550740486
 Even <unk> , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this <unk> capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line .	404.12143451096176
 On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for .	452.151496527522
 One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk 's speeches as <unk> .	1343.184515940199
 But he hastened to add that , if United States policies were not always clear , despite Mr Rusk 's analysis of the various global danger points and <unk> for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy .	583.0935233131011
 <unk> <unk> A certain <unk> may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a <unk> affair , with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents <unk> .	417.74105814853414
 The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr Rusk 's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and <unk> frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to <unk> firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .	750.080104856146
 The Secretary of State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months .	298.5956215947947
 But where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only <unk> the United States ' profound attachment to the alliance , <unk> of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO 's disposal in European waters .	486.395002210743
 The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another <unk> in Berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole .	386.88915442044123
 <unk> <unk> The secretary 's greatest achievement is perhaps the <unk> of NATO realization that East-West friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection .	738.3689752659262
 The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic <unk> and Development when <unk> as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent .	450.2221382433734
 This increase in the threshold , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance 's most difficult problems in the months to come .	302.36615938676243
 Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled .	1110.84528130002
 WASHINGTON The Kennedy administration moves <unk> toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy <unk> for the first time .	865.0851661381179
 There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos .	434.4088921768156
 The United States , State Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam .	1539.047611330641
 They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this .	518.9358829907366
 The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated .	1244.7771737260075
 But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility .	325.46041756016837
 POLICIES <unk> The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos , rather than continue to insist on a <unk> of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference .	697.1658428457788
 This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make .	418.42630649741733
 It <unk> these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration .	390.1553776279317
 Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas .	796.7554948343222
 But with the months moving on- and the immediate <unk> with the Communists showing no gain for the free world- the question arises How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ?	1402.0810352328647
 <unk> <unk> Richard M Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union .	805.121985964309
 He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy 's tendency to be too <unk> .	300.15315450462856
 GOP <unk> It does not take a <unk> poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this <unk> the situation as Republicans see it .	562.8615356251785
 They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made <unk> and monumental <unk> in Cuba .	348.34541208416124
 One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he did n't attack the Kennedy administration on this score .	1113.5120108352266
 His reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now .	117.72000077935336
 But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first .	528.8344464123622
 The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator <unk> B Morton R of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican National Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination .	1223.1987455652804
 Kennedy administration policies also have been <unk> now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston University , <unk> , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators .	921.0062284900802
 <unk> <unk> This group <unk> with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by <unk> groups .	209.12294316516275
 It <unk> that the United States seek instead to <unk> the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic <unk> and a resumption of trade relations ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds .	720.733648214871
 Mr Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation .	807.9702223262759
 But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated .	984.3741671168872
 Until the Cuban <unk> and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had <unk> a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr Nixon and the professors .	588.9299680615459
 AID <unk> <unk> Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the <unk> period of the administration .	687.28724001962
 <unk> efforts were made to remove pin <unk> from administration statements .	583.3566256198138
 <unk> on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed .	1731.1290619151532
 But thus far there has been no response in kind .	377.8698208009629
 Foreign aid programs were <unk> to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations .	1105.4351213022017
 In Laos , the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture .	1339.7867367093575
 Again and again it asked the Communists to freeze the military situation in Laos .	545.7457037717007
 But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate .	1003.9314100661376
 And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization .	2352.140005692777
 SEATO was steamed up and prepared <unk> plans for coping with the military losses in Laos .	682.5387033019159
 But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos .	664.3118089117911
 Some SEATO nations <unk> , however .	397.1827887407253
 There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet Nam .	896.3990086397732
 The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos .	574.0233679514859
 The pro-Western government , which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma neutralist government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army .	812.7092661013083
 There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the <unk> .	290.88634770373835
 If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma , whom it felt was too <unk> of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish them .	566.5578912937359
 One factor was the statement of Senator J W <unk> D of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .	803.3878582448369
 He declared on March 25 that the United States had <unk> a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of Prince Souvanna .	416.9059640203325
 WASHINGTON The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile <unk> in the United States .	628.7611150151835
 The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation .	246.44759249097336
 In an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President 's committee on <unk> <unk> and <unk> , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems .	555.8914827957706
 The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in <unk> this disturbing crime trend .	782.9649364788314
 <unk> <unk> The President has also called upon the Attorney General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem .	280.9362176051811
 Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L <unk> , a special assistant <unk> the Attorney General , as executive director of the new Committee on <unk> <unk> and Youth <unk> .	427.7363411681406
 His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases <unk> juvenile <unk> have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in <unk> .	564.6692026790389
 Among <unk> reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and <unk> involved persons under 18 years of age .	587.5435936707423
 East Providence should organize its civil defense <unk> and begin by <unk> a full-time director , Raymond H Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes .	1381.9135080170572
 Mr Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time .	816.5949629519281
 East Providence now has no civil defense program .	1667.3780650099618
 Mr Hawksley , the state 's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years .	366.66393083997457
 He is not interested in being named a full-time director .	315.8461879169319
 Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation 's civil defense program , Mr Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director .	996.6590820976689
 He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about 3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to <unk> the salary costs .	613.3037423565596
 Mr Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job .	790.549792869773
 One of these men is former Fire Chief John A <unk> , he said .	474.4659072359573
 Along with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized .	569.6278047347838
 Mr Hawksley said .	653.5873972814807
 One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program .	580.3838026136895
 <unk> funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , <unk> and rescue trucks , he said .	368.2691163316256
 Mr Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station .	2022.4409250485394
 He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the <unk> section of the city and the other to the <unk> area .	90.53379169339539
 Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack .	311.8367012335574
 The Narragansett <unk> <unk> grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a <unk> theater in <unk> would be another .	143.47124974386702
 <unk> residents would go to the <unk> assembly point .	168.6280581984749
 Mr Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack .	734.2455320709471
 Such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know .	339.1921270668593
 If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally .	824.5605866714433
 One of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid .	172.31419673229144
 Other steps would be developed after information <unk> down to the local level from the federal government .	237.08994544047945
 Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind .	1399.7500541798208
 Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly .	494.33682255461395
 The governor 's move into the so-called blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R Grant , deputy city clerk of Central Falls .	1014.12494006863
 A copy was released to the press .	195.197861911188
 Mr Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant .	949.7013477732687
 The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature .	354.4260134865111
 While the city council suggested that the <unk> Council might perform the review , Mr Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty Gen J Joseph Nugent to get the benefit of his views .	624.2048355429449
 He will then appoint the study committee with Mr Nugent 's cooperation , the governor said .	481.60251935866665
 I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings , Mr Notte said , to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and <unk> groups affected by these laws .	439.00906564377897
 The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales .	788.7588751363234
 The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws .	905.6621374216367
 Should there be evidence they are <unk> , he has said , the state police will step into the situation .	245.02351893887644
 There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws .	661.8190928509845
 The statutes , similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the <unk> .	480.95062375102106
 The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday .	1767.4519039678123
 The only day they have a chance to compete with large <unk> is on Sunday , the council 's resolution said .	286.38933558448906
 The small shops must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community , according to the resolution , which added that they also are the source of <unk> for thousands of our neighbors .	244.72315482384494
 It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government .	1224.7065352449158
 The council advised the governor that large <unk> , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business on Sunday .	774.4291681832983
 They operate on a volume basis , it was contended , and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community .	326.30606252282627
 Liberals and <unk> in both <unk> Democratic and <unk> should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George H Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday .	1154.687684702033
 Mr Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the <unk> Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system .	489.5320232215041
 He suggested that a <unk> of forces might allow the average <unk> a better pull at the right lever for him on election day .	318.2448321397985
 He said he was <unk> that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 .	122.68683085125622
 That , he added , was when he was a very young man , a machinist and <unk> by trade .	115.10496565924548
 That was before I studied law .	279.55431810213605
 Some of my fellow workers were <unk> me for an office in the Socialist Party .	430.036794067982
 The lawyer with whom I studied law <unk> me off the Socialist track .	709.1182373203159
 He <unk> me to the right <unk> the free enterprise track .	179.42491606619296
 He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the <unk> of all resources .	187.93823982004432
 He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties .	779.4264814459185
 Mr Reama , who retired as vice president of the American <unk> Co in 1955 said , Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national <unk> but neither told us how to achieve it .	683.856414367118
 He said he favors wage increases for <unk> but manufacturers are caught in a profit <unk> and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added .	477.3839126692024
 <unk> the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr Reama said A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own .	644.7197878682043
 Mr Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling .	1108.3087431746803
 A petition bearing the signatures of more than <unk> Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town .	763.7300283655876
 William A Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond <unk> <unk> .	725.586435095856
 The law which <unk> home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of <unk> for <unk> of the signatures within 10 days and Mr Martinelli happens to hold that post .	446.04046615059326
 Mr Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the <unk> of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days .	879.4726707195772
 He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of <unk> completes its work .	466.56844366650444
 A difference of opinion arose between Mr Martinelli and John P <unk> , town <unk> , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled .	434.9828748446731
 Mr Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while Mr <unk> said that a special election might be called instead .	345.40398373624697
 Mr <unk> said that he had consulted several Superior Court <unk> in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures .	695.9638564641001
 He assured Mr Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible .	407.22619261857733
 Mr Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement .	1722.384569892927
 He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes .	384.6943232067161
 After inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow through on it , he declared .	495.8359468246851
 It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will <unk> the movement .	359.59075968530743
 He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required <unk> ballot for posts on the charter commission .	322.27112117651444
 Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement , he indicated , and to tell them what this will mean for the town .	276.7933062337242
 He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September .	488.82142980187587
 Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town 's <unk> Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter .	968.848000939669
 <unk> opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated .	247.6770581183309
 <unk> of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed false <unk> .	786.9040130711606
 Several <unk> affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston <unk> District sewer system .	454.344505697272
 Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay <unk> at the local police station may be taken at Monday 's special North Providence Town Council meeting .	2312.8394069995193
 Council president Frank <unk> said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town <unk> Michael A <unk> to draft the ordinance .	1634.3467354453808
 At the last session of the General Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective .	482.96388562741225
 Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation .	496.22709729472587
 At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition .	1545.892838059568
 Local police have hesitated to <unk> them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense .	737.8918588558661
 <unk> - James P Mitchell and Sen Walter H Jones <unk> , last night <unk> on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is <unk> on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism .	885.4705910451162
 Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen Wayne <unk> Jr <unk> did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel .	1359.4381139114257
 The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club .	2995.5707962261004
 It was greeted with a chorus of <unk> by 500 women in <unk> Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women 's Clubs .	357.70518802624525
 Hughes said Monday , It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the <unk> <unk> after Eisenhower retired .	625.5306123793463
 Now he 's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the <unk> remains to the people of the state .	130.61890635270638
 Sunday he had added , We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president h but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership .	529.9164795856806
 Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign .	339.2650348320625
 How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this ?	584.7891557487148
 he asked .	302.67928052236806
 The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his <unk> .	424.32958960345223
 Mitchell said the <unk> of the outcome in last fall 's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue .	591.1861186248682
 <unk> <unk> Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president .	484.48352506350324
 He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign , he said , because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into <unk> an old national campaign .	397.84240824995254
 The audience last night did not respond with either applause or <unk> to mention of Hughes ' remark .	747.7946173795475
 <unk> spoke on the merit of having an open primary .	337.39470081636534
 He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign .	180.89542990580853
 State aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industry .	755.9897266445636
 <unk> <unk> Mitchell <unk> the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the <unk> State Senate Must share the blame for this .	361.97069439875486
 Nothing that <unk> last year had lost the <unk> <unk> Co plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform .	396.185210183533
 But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time , Mitchell said .	347.8987869965291
 Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his <unk> for Mitchell .	481.84963826386195
 He said Mitchell is against the <unk> of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises .	602.636924692224
 He calls for help while saying he is against <unk> , but you ca n't have it both ways , Jones said .	368.43745327998886
 The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue .	472.7537841448511
 <unk> <unk> <unk> , Mitchell said in a statement I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J Hughes .	810.1648320609278
 His reference to <unk> carcass ' or <unk> remains ' of the president 's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the <unk> intentions of the free nations .	268.2737228609954
 I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste .	1035.3318171786832
 Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature .	417.4406082596534
 It can only <unk> to Mr Hughes ' <unk> .	153.076102296544
 <unk> <unk> <unk> Sen Charles W Sandman , <unk> May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination .	1027.2173954087243
 Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones .	1609.2189098827848
 Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party 's <unk> with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years .	686.14189314956
 Sandman said The announcement that Sen Clifford Case <unk> , has decided to spend all his available time <unk> for Mr Mitchell is a dead <unk> .	845.9106145124334
 It is a desperate effort to <unk> up a <unk> candidate who has proven he can not answer any questions about New Jersey 's problems .	459.6052673674652
 We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington .	547.6814053706071
 That failed .	207.73067863957593
 We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr Mitchell some of the glow of Sen Case 's candidacy of last year .	984.2553075542569
 That , too , will fail .	144.8530726225933
 Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs Harriet <unk> <unk> of 330 <unk> Ave , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee .	946.7656744162393

 County <unk> <unk> R Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper <unk> in those counties in the state which still use them .	431.42049915384166
 The proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a lip service word .	825.7561909341089
 Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge .	1035.431183167268
 Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January , <unk> .	448.2283194425173
 Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically <unk> , he added that the vital interest in election results <unk> county lines .	872.6179784356054
 The candidacy of Mayor James J <unk> of West Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County , was supported today by Edward W <unk> , West Orange public safety commissioner .	1323.8553562848024
 <unk> , a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization 's candidate , <unk> William <unk> , for the vacancy left by the resignation of <unk> <unk> , now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals .	283.00882551700954
 My experience as public safety commissioner , <unk> said , has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer .	568.0688363535786
 Jim <unk> fits that description .	1116.8919862821235

 He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the <unk> Inn When I come back here after the November election you 'll think , 'You 're my man- you 're the kind of governor we 're glad we elected ' .	1454.1847385285216
 He said , We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time .	243.17948766423035
 <unk> <unk> In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said , The three Republican candidates for governor are <unk> over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary .	489.2716856919168
 But we 'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform .	480.5536516645538
 We 'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson .	303.6911967591249
 We 'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November .	241.4646852701066
 He said , You can see signs of the Republicans ' feeble attack on the Meyner administration .	502.5411806055453
 But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead .	249.3879647200359
 He urged New Jersey to become a full partner in the <unk> actions of President Kennedy .	464.30897933756125
 He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the <unk> of industry by Southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry .	289.6350241316279

 He said legislation for a 60 million bond issue to <unk> the program is expected to be introduced Monday .	433.35470948903895
 <unk> <unk> The plan will provide 45 million for purchase of open land by the state .	405.79979399872155
 The other 15 million is to be <unk> to municipalities on a matching fund basis .	290.88010876801553
 Hughes said , This is not a plan to <unk> <unk> but to <unk> it , pointing out the state population has increased <unk> each year since 1950 .	289.9050405756393
 He said Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve .	718.2118204987714
 Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved .	826.952293006727
 He said no matter what stand he takes it would be <unk> that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans .	172.9596001432926
 After the primary , he promised , I 'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration .	420.564231918001
 I 'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican <unk> .	224.20066143880837
 <unk> - Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are <unk> <unk> this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues .	771.7879381706587
 The outgoing members , whose <unk> terms will <unk> a week after the April 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory <unk> , to remember the state committee by .	843.8064281004436
 There may be other 1961 state committee <unk> come April 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters .	591.9675030013625
 A special presentation was made to Mrs <unk> Thompson of Red Bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee .	543.7917806653851
 She also was the original GOP national <unk> from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women 's suffrage amendment .	793.3650204994738
 She served one <unk> term on the national committee .	331.9716473786596
 <unk> <unk> up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R <unk> and Abraham D <unk> as running mates .	1262.5004980523822
 At the same time reaction among <unk> Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor 's reported plan was generally favorable .	473.9598073679065
 Some <unk> Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years .	526.376565480496
 The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor 's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders .	1150.7886252810817
 Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party .	1006.8272825382192
 <unk> <unk> Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr Wagner for the <unk> nomination in the Sept 7 Democratic primary .	2165.1152660092275
 These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city .	402.58094289304
 Their view is that <unk> changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor .	535.1030051479212
 In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , Mr Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A Buckley , the Bronx Democratic leader , and with Joseph T <unk> , the Brooklyn Democratic leader .	1181.698324601799
 <unk> <unk> <unk> As usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with <unk> G De <unk> , the Manhattan leader .	269.51734230087635
 He is publicly on record as believing Mr De <unk> should be replaced for the good of the party .	324.32913305029666
 Last night the Mayor visited Mr Buckley at the Bronx leader 's home for a discussion of the situation .	580.5937111875736
 Apparently he believes Mr Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization 's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle .	992.7460552835828
 In talks with Mr Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader 's <unk> to dropping Controller Lawrence E Gerosa , who lives in the Bronx , from this year 's ticket .	958.2855240384285
 But Mr Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr Gerosa 's successor .	595.1500455148582
 <unk> AND <unk> <unk> The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr <unk> , who lives in Queens , to replace <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr <unk> , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr Gerosa as the candidate for Controller .	358.31792238651497
 The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties <unk> on the Hunter College <unk> in the Bronx .	402.340080094943
 After his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday 's New York Times .	444.68769761657717
 The Mayor said It did n't come from me .	444.81925606953854
 But as I have said before , if I announce my candidacy , I will have something definite to say about running mates .	521.0880614954908

 A political scientist writes of the growth of alienated voters , who believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control .	1508.0941554692552
 h These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to <unk> them .	350.22465033669084
 <unk> is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the <unk> of Edwin O'Connor 's novel , The Last <unk> .	255.7073837092704
 But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject .	197.8902504114737
 A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year .	757.8603004661536
 <unk> in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations .	368.8683183361282

 WASHINGTON , JUNE 18 - Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers .	4001.3818986712904
 In the Senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition .	552.9474321012145
 In the House , the <unk> coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration 's housing bill , while more <unk> is expected in an attempt to advance the <unk> bill .	260.857015883454
 The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee .	544.2753597225749
 It is expected to be reported out Tuesday , but this is a little uncertain .	212.70536099029718
 The panel 's action depends on the return of Representative James W <unk> , Democrat of Arkansas , who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn 's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor .	716.3525340968096
 Mr <unk> has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday .	386.89834352715735
 <unk> IS <unk> The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans .	1007.6520448088681
 The Democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week .	526.567872855186
 The <unk> measure , which was passed last Monday by the Senate , provides for <unk> mortgages at low <unk> for <unk> families .	286.693553099374
 It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories .	2009.7233778714017
 The education bill appears to be temporarily <unk> in the Rules Committee , where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are <unk> because of the religious controversy .	468.193896913407
 They are James J <unk> of Queens and Thomas P <unk> Jr of Massachusetts .	553.2487515721831
 THREE <unk> TO <unk> What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill <unk> the National Defense Education Act of 1958 .	770.7927081030226
 This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other <unk> facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics .	862.4699742491614
 Mr <unk> and Mr <unk> are not willing to vote on the <unk> measure until the defense education bill <unk> the House Education and Labor Committee .	425.604411225397
 About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps .	748.9480162378504
 In the <unk> budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval , <unk> would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies .	505.7719582766722
 <unk> projects proposed by private groups are at the <unk> stage , Gordon <unk> , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a Washington interview .	346.57427406077454
 Six of these were proposed by religious groups .	778.1038746072119
 They will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin America .	646.2287168524765
 QUESTION <unk> <unk> with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals .	664.1620941906021
 There are a number of ways this could happen , the <unk> pointed out , and here is an example Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled .	474.04591308152794
 When he protested , the hotel owner said Why do you worry ?	1072.992845011571
 The U S Government is paying for it .	472.42445112049086
 The U S Government pays for all its overseas workers .	912.8645491892402
 <unk> <unk> I do n't work for the Government , the American said .	92.34896600381018

 The hotel owner <unk> .	242.29666656398408
 <unk> thing , he said .	47.69873420986849
 And then , some <unk> remarked , there is a more classical <unk> problem Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ?	1036.3916742832425
 R Sargent Shriver Jr , director of the corps , is certain that they can .	923.558978574511
 No religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive Peace Corps funds unless it <unk> all <unk> on the project it proposes .	603.1587866124714
 <unk> , JUNE 18 - At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia , Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming Look , he took everything I had !	1260.6687644857075
 Mr Khrushchev was <unk> in the <unk> mood of the successful <unk> .	81.25727793852748
 Indonesia is one of the twenty <unk> countries of Asia , Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid .	642.0538148268014
 The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the <unk> nations .	459.2090128133196
 The Communist countries <unk> more than <unk> in economic aid alone last year , according to Western estimates .	569.4127334114187
 This was the biggest annual <unk> since the Communist program for the <unk> countries made its modest beginning in 1954 .	350.6590990597283
 In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries .	1537.2989475803145
 UNITED <unk> , N Y , JUNE 18 - A committee of experts has recommended that a country 's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations .	690.8075459039455
 This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations .	543.4561447347186
 One effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India .	386.6072020773294
 India is the most populous United Nations member with more than <unk> inhabitants .	1061.8310424848721
 The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report .	335.3173619217504

 The decision was made in <unk> by Prince Boun <unk> , Premier of the pro-Western royal Government ; Prince Souvanna Phouma , leader of the nation 's <unk> and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc , and Prince <unk> , head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces .	630.7577104539622
 The latter two are <unk> .	83.0866852449777
 Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western <unk> who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth <unk> session of the <unk> conference on the future of Laos .	304.3846349909693
 An agreement among the <unk> on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats conceded .	686.5873839713167
 But no one was overly optimistic .	551.7247917264325

 The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week .	524.3026350877465
 Princess <unk> , Prince Souvanna Phouma 's young daughter , read the <unk> ' statement .	846.0897107987822
 They had a two-hour luncheon together in an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation , she said .	458.4163438504695
 The three <unk> agreed upon a <unk> agenda for their talks , which are to last three days .	248.00329580934414
 The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days .	502.39625083403627
 TO <unk> WITH <unk> The meetings in <unk> , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government .	377.6265602016733
 <unk> of William S Pfaff Jr , 41 , as promotion manager of The <unk> <unk> Company was announced Saturday by John F <unk> , president of the company .	573.3964235926603
 Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned .	4888.218406806663
 The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department .	446.7751925120833
 He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen <unk> school , <unk> High school and <unk> business college .	438.83113965660476

 They <unk> at <unk> Miles <unk> WASHINGTON - <unk> of <unk> seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan 20 .	875.2592366034665
 Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this <unk> as President John F Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the <unk> ceremonies and ride down this historic <unk> route .	2518.60589929965
 Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint .	429.3390438064163
 But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it .	841.2809168008797
 MANY <unk> Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government 's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments .	873.8327892000577
 Of course , <unk> Pennsylvania , the White House , is the most famous address of the free world .	181.43989344201248
 Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about <unk> high .	1126.9294988442446
 Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about <unk> years old .	648.9892900426573
 In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade .	1206.1464720428553
 They were the <unk> and they wanted to vote .	102.69772326180689
 In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time .	335.1950442234813
 <unk> ON SQUARE Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National <unk> building where hundreds of thousands of this country 's most valuable records are kept .	1465.4922138364707
 Also the department of justice building is located where J <unk> Hoover <unk> over the federal bureau of investigation .	771.9276307145386
 Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania , <unk> with lines that are underground .	920.2653433591146
 Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points <unk> Lafayette Square , opposite the White House .	1838.868854033405
 In this historic square are several statutes , but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen Andrew Jackson , hero of the Battle of New Orleans .	523.8719798527145
 Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units .	2433.377266717156
 About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade .	668.0646814014881
 Division one of the parade will be the service <unk> .	192.93006783242032
 Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas , the respective states of the President and of <unk> L B Johnson .	460.9892085255891
 Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union .	229.64671858389858
 Division three will be headed by the <unk> followed by 12 states ; division four will be headed by the Navy , followed by 11 states ; division five , by the Air Force followed by 11 states .	877.1373272123682

 <unk> , <unk> - What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi ?	782.829475656893
 Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state 's immediate political future .	462.54063733228065
 This is largely because of the <unk> of the man who operates the <unk> of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million <unk> Gov Ross Barnett .	274.9126713847921
 Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well .	981.5204081971318
 Consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year .	857.7756135428118
 <unk> BE <unk> Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .	921.9251417615204
 The <unk> <unk> of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of <unk> and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his <unk> quest for the governor 's office .	308.78888518909815
 There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a <unk> .	611.5981391822153
 Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a <unk> of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the 1960 legislative session .	710.766384122333
 If Barnett does n't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session .	356.4964767522784
 The odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year .	467.30706852830906
 <unk> ISSUE <unk> always get restless for a special session whether for the <unk> or the <unk> per <unk> is not certain and if they start <unk> .	259.3778160384572
 Barnett is not expected to be able to <unk> the pressure .	121.17072157790155
 The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state 's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .	621.8379394035379
 With eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E Smith as the one most likely to go , the <unk> battle will put to a test the <unk> power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature .	539.2969256093281
 Mississippi 's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House .	414.1575201256129
 <unk> badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party <unk> and <unk> , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a <unk> .	559.533684535452
 And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together .	339.77800756750275
 FUTURE <unk> Barnett , as the <unk> head of the Democratic party , apparently must make the move to <unk> relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the <unk> ranks to completely <unk> him as a party <unk> .	234.94706291615526
 With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election .	839.053279821868
 Now , the picture is <unk> , and even US <unk> James O <unk> and John C <unk> , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status .	249.54418044162807
 Reports are that it is more than probability that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen .	738.0967484138987
 <unk> <unk> , <unk> - The Gov <unk> H Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor 's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses .	535.3913334517945
 The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue .	656.2257671282675
 But it might give way shortly to another <unk> <unk> that of finances in state government .	396.9923203239716
 The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent .	643.9060871074875
 The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program .	470.2697741187187
 But the <unk> of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation .	471.0760489148245
 <unk> <unk> Indeed , the administration 's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat .	291.1560804392198
 The administration could not say why 28 million was needed for a <unk> program .	327.53885380860504
 The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the <unk> revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can <unk> the required two-thirds vote .	489.0749542796707
 The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature <unk> .	379.4621678236607
 Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to <unk> .	409.3523505087079
 If it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration .	301.2949773866177
 He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature .	418.8534757292929
 Actually , Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway .	783.5326192089667
 Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the <unk> losing battle to block token integration .	1922.3647286267037
 This is not the sort of thing most <unk> would care to acknowledge publicly .	302.00886456232416
 They would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be <unk> .	250.58087650925523
 <unk> <unk> <unk> of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition .	306.06004213035516
 He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle .	295.2296212254913
 Then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the 28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period .	650.9976664211
 It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that 28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one .	246.2291694553733
 But if the administration should find it does not need the 28 million for a <unk> program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes .	329.9094131554827
 This would be in perfect <unk> with the underlying concern in the <unk> the shortage of cash .	158.97453752487763
 It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .	367.51180261715155
 If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma .	626.7331433628351
 Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or <unk> its estimates of anticipated revenues .	701.2241917139083
 <unk> PROBLEM In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another <unk> at raising additional revenues through a tax <unk> .	445.1569164921324
 The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor .	580.8381917543502
 It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem .	238.38424030211297
 But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature .	571.996644502054
 This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the <unk> to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more <unk> to a tax proposal later in the year .	210.4534529791423
 A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to <unk> .	485.9647864708521
 Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations <unk> to profit themselves .	1366.9246678767986
 The new year might see some <unk> , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms .	551.793639429384

 So I started practicing on it in spring training .	753.9448866740911

 One was on a <unk> screen pass from the <unk> 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon 's territory .	452.0928562185931
 As soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it , Meek said .	580.0287540046903
 He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy halfback Terry <unk> had time to turn around .	617.5336520130891
 He really <unk> him h he nailed it for a yard loss .	269.8644525054519
 The Air Force 's , and the game 's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob <unk> which Gannon <unk> on his own <unk> and returned 22 yards .	522.8999443368201
 He just lay back there and waited for it , Meek said .	375.3567310099935
 He almost brought it back all the way .	238.40896631622365
 Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and <unk> Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice .	3226.1360150276128
 Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game , Meek said .	800.0919403061603
 He 'll be out of action all this week .	257.8285050629017
 He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game .	297.0508381597564
 There is definitely some <unk> damage in his knee .	329.7355102126328
 Rice has not played since <unk> a knee in the opener with Maryland .	516.7487701282038
 He 's looking a lot better , and he 's able to run , Meek explained .	354.6423056793989
 We 'll let him do a lot of running this week , but I do n't know if he 'll be able to play .	273.8134276150269
 The game players saw the Air Force film Monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves <unk> for 45 minutes .	730.7985387813238

 The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League <unk> a <unk> triumph over the Denver <unk> but their visit will be a short one .	798.1988389670614
 The Texans have two more road <unk> at Buffalo and <unk> before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank Stram 's men will meet the <unk> just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in <unk> <unk> .	371.41848222342975
 Buffalo coach <unk> Ramsey , who has become one of the game 's greatest collectors of <unk> , apparently now has found a productive pair in two <unk> Football <unk> , M C Reynolds and Warren <unk> .	538.2658566371606
 <unk> , the former Louisiana State field general , came off the bench for his debut with the <unk> Sunday and directed his new team to a <unk> upset victory over the Houston <unk> , defending league champions .	485.6867810197615
 Just our luck !	2503.063755774049
 exclaimed Stram .	7889.516936440277
 <unk> would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way .	819.9407940459845
 Ramsey has a thing or two to <unk> about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous <unk> without the <unk> of a top star , Jack <unk> , though he did the team 's <unk> while nursing a knee injury .	400.35406054092954
 Our interior line and out <unk> played exceptionally well , said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game .	1025.8121164136032
 In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job .	586.0475939076888
 The Texans won the game through ball control , with <unk> Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes .	1790.9571131970154
 We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack , explained Stram .	819.8786443686076
 They can be going along , doing little damage , then <unk> , <unk> they can hit a couple of passes on you for <unk> and put you in trouble .	263.80631145585335
 The <unk> did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off .	325.51854826519417
 The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> halfback .	185.18318097791925
 He was called upon 26 <unk> more than all of the other <unk> <unk> and delivered <unk> yards .	171.28713489846538
 The Texans made themselves a <unk> break on the opening <unk> when Denver 's Al <unk> was <unk> loose from the ball when Dave <unk> , the <unk> halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas .	584.0017332903519
 A quick touchdown resulted .	1476.8308492075187
 That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away , said Stram , <unk> , I think I 'll put that play in the book .	380.83303648639895

 <unk> <unk> made a spectacular play on <unk> 's <unk> in the hole in the fourth and <unk> came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base .	258.3727280139512

 This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden <unk> .	150.60103180683416
 Jensen got only six hits in 46 <unk> for a <unk> batting average in the first 12 games .	808.3493831037792
 He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno , <unk> , where his wife , former Olympic <unk> <unk> <unk> Ann <unk> , awaited .	508.4172348177463

 You 'll probably get a ball bat on the head .	430.21851233681207
 He 's mad at the world .	99.20815650152443
 But Jackie had gone into the station .	296.5920397151659
 Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand .	427.21309378007413
 I told him who I was and he was quite cold .	232.98735840214403
 But he warmed up after a while .	336.0666996779175
 I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a <unk> and said anything he Liston got was through a <unk> .	311.26234434269924
 He said he had never talked to Liston .	269.3552305975791
 Liston is Bill Liston , baseball writer for the Boston <unk> , who quoted Jensen as saying I ca n't hit anymore .	1955.1729255419132
 I ca n't run .	356.73395907977357

 <unk> WHEN IT <unk> baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up <unk> <unk> to start millions of <unk> to <unk> .	370.82495797175005
 And so it was over the weekend what with <unk> Warren Spahn pitching his <unk> masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants ' Willie Mays <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> Sunday .	471.2712961576486
 Both , of course , were remarkable <unk> and further <unk> the fact that baseball <unk> is the national pastime .	217.39820092109585
 Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's <unk> pitching probably reached the most hearts .	1107.066612112905
 It was a real <unk> to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the <unk> milestone .	233.02523583367102
 And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , <unk> I was 40 , and a <unk> big <unk> .	201.34429764623178
 THE <unk> AND <unk> Spahn waved off his new <unk> as one of those good days .	368.40151808124523
 But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the <unk> great <unk> in the game 's history .	273.9617161155023
 Yes , with Bob Grove , Carl <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Art <unk> , Vernon <unk> , et al .	281.69233605940474
 Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a <unk> fine fellow , a ball player 's ball player , as they say in the trade .	546.5683005832803
 I remember his <unk> performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of <unk> .	617.8307332053356
 <unk> DOES N'T <unk> how to merely go through the motions , remarked <unk> <unk> , another all-out guy , who played <unk> that day and <unk> one over the clubhouse .	439.41823035951137
 The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 , joined six other <unk> who <unk> four home runs in a span of nine <unk> .	694.6099021072293
 Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience .	357.76666606680993
 Bobby <unk> of Boston was the first to hit four at home and <unk> Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn 's <unk> Field .	540.1552136637011

 <unk> 'S BIG DAY <unk> the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle .	1226.6256873440673
 This is an issue which <unk> down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you 're an American or National fan and <unk> or <unk> .	226.41776561765323
 The record books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace .	427.5335463095788
 In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases .	2106.7622215516217

 Willie 's lifetime batting average of <unk> is 11 points beyond Mickey 's .	3470.2836948204654
 The Giants who had been <unk> with the bat in their <unk> <unk> Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park .	304.0619392279231
 It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump .	1551.89373500913
 THE <unk> TV audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob <unk> that the games are not to be <unk> out when his Bears are playing at home .	618.4838428633789
 This rule providing for a <unk> of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game 's top rulers .	735.815323826329
 The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the Living Room <unk> Club when games were cut off .	761.1025493702633
 Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy .	471.4967783560172
 This year , I am told , the <unk> network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here .	352.98006567711104
 There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .	615.3840107443751
 It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level .	747.375354234151
 You would be surprised how many fans <unk> stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy .	1148.580413463507
 This dissatisfaction led to <unk> 's request that the <unk> not be terminated before the end of the game .	180.1175802621567
