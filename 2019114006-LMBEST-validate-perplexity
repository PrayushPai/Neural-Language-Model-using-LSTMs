 Damp also .	536.5929313795866
 He looked around the room and then called out Come here , quick ?	309.49157038520104
 What is it ?	70.91352288324659
 Barbara asked , standing in the doorway .	116.80402332534109
 I 've solved the mystery of the little bag .	196.38730149154682
 There it is h and there is what was in it .	79.351649287988
 But where do people go swimming in Paris ?	1043.41264662057
 That boat in the river , maybe .	208.14689041101448
 What boat ?	1280.4295366047368
 There 's a big boat anchored near the Place de la Concorde , with a swimming pool in it- did n't you notice it ?	594.7132096882733
 But if he has time to go swimming , he had time to be with us .	79.36818515483047
 She looked at him in surprise .	147.21904356449411
 I know , he said , reading her mind .	93.18042476488776
 I do n't know what I 'm going to do with you .	70.16532693980679
 It 's because we are in France , he said , and know so few people .	133.0612918798736
 So something like this matters more than it would at home .	308.5895392829691
 Also , he was so nice when he was nice .	114.87188403779993
 All because I did n't feel like dancing .	205.89905851981604
 I do n't think it was that , really .	104.94607771950695
 Then what was it ?	82.66315587649673
 I do n't know .	39.9011178383285
 I wish I did .	193.81278394773423
 The tweed coat , maybe .	122.57025711964981
 The thing about Eugene is that he 's very proud .	286.5147112823665
 And the thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing suit pointed out , is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be .	447.4619291636715
 For instance- what about all those people Harold Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly , as if this were the one moment they would ever have together , their one chance of knowing each other ?	418.468025308764
 Fortunately , the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered , or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields .	328.54688596867265
 And in any case , answers may clarify but they do not change anything .	292.19636778082645
 h he brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes , of about a hundred pounds ' weight .	134.8194250610922
 They took Jesus 's body , then , and wrapped it in winding-clothes with the spices ; that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial .	212.60489951492968
 Listed as present at the Descent were Mary , Mary 's sister , Mary Magdalene , John , Joseph of Arimathea , Nicodemus .	108.9202227922998
 Search as he might , he could find no place where the Bible spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus .	170.806740709869
 Mostly the scene was crowded with mourners , such as the dramatic Dell'Arca Lamentation in Bologna , where the grief-stricken spectators had usurped Mary 's last poignant moment .	97.51634137325311
 In his concept there could be no one else present .	238.3218324475194
 His first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe .	174.03131655651123
 When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap ?	648.4094976732308
 Perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground , while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate 's asking for Christ 's body , Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes , and the others had gone home to mourn .	126.75531071211846
 Those who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses .	117.06375352294069
 They would feel what Mary was undergoing .	388.15960052886436
 There would be no halos , no angels .	70.04080833678941
 These would be two human beings , whom God had chosen .	256.8165347848718
 He felt close to Mary , having spent so long concentrating on the beginning of her journey .	266.99570469108835
 Now she was intensely alive , anguished ; her son was dead .	237.53712355868052
 Even though he would later be resurrected , he was at this moment dead indeed , the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross .	169.8569542378406
 In his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt for his mother ; only what Mary felt for her son .	320.3662527689126
 Jesus ' inert body would be passive , his eyes closed .	321.7934077314722
 Mary would have to carry the human communication .	274.32420692880544
 This seemed right to him .	103.86618582387626
 It was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems .	141.9419109872148
 Since his Christ was to be life size , how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming ungainly ?	400.05570926926015
 His Mary would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion , yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child .	158.19361236012278
 There was only one way to accomplish this by design , by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept .	249.09288276892624
 He started by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper .	371.03295991880464
 Visually , these approximated what he was feeling within himself .	84.81746965865096
 At the same time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping at the stalls , storing up fresh impressions of what they looked like , how they moved .	176.96056824810572
 In particular he sought the gentle , sweet-faced nuns , with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads , remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper .	178.45573861892646
 Discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a study of the anatomy of folds .	86.67896235968958
 He improvised as he went along , completing a life-size clay figure , then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber , to the consistency of thick mud .	187.57889188410545
 No fold could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the Madonna 's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive support to Christ 's body , to intensify her inner turmoil .	185.59816547140667
 When the cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made .	116.4323383724163
 So that 's sculpture , commented Argiento wryly , when he had sluiced down the floor for a week , making mud pies .	182.44694224283566
 Michelangelo grinned .	217.46526212631372
 See , Argiento , if you control the way these folds are bunched , like this , or made to flow , you can enrich the body attitudes .	183.2723826012211
 They can have as much tactile appeal as flesh and bone .	463.06771816179037
 He went into the Jewish quarter , wanting to draw Hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how Christ might have looked .	269.69003593103616
 The Jewish section was in Trastevere , near the Tiber at the church of San Francesco a Ripa .	57.27371181036893
 The colony had been small until the Spanish Inquisition of 1492 drove many Jews into Rome .	265.9619023653246
 Here , for the most part , they were well treated , as a reminder of the Old Testament heritage of Christianity ; many of their gifted members were prominent in the Vatican as physicians , musicians , bankers .	299.1463765565177
 The men did not object to his sketching them while they went about their work , but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to pose .	150.30083645105867
 He was told to ask for Rabbi Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon .	181.6416520443715
 Michelangelo found the rabbi in the room of study , a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey eyes , robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head .	155.19722100940584
 He was reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his congregation .	62.395932329498585
 When Michelangelo explained why he had come , Rabbi Melzi replied gravely The Bible forbids us to bow down to or to make graven images .	490.394972989275
 That is why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture .	412.50204417523395
 But , Rabbi Melzi , you do n't object to others creating works of art ?	556.1483953285871
 Not at all .	124.51676748837167
 Each religion has its own tenets .	181.4957611949815
 I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble .	122.4087722642283
 I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew .	409.75092035834643
 I can not accomplish this if you will not help me .	144.33432141690687
 The rabbi said thoughtfully , I would not want my people to get in trouble with the Church .	126.68216260990762
 I am working for the Cardinal of San Dionigi .	169.51398880851946
 I 'm sure he would approve .	238.0048985862939
 What kind of models would you prefer ?	603.1006778447178
 Workmen .	21.277341551974114
 In their mid-thirties .	29.36825006803601
 Not bulky laborers , but sinewy men .	427.2716583057442
 With intelligence .	383.412072271745
 And sensitivity .	515.2501360823767
 Rabbi Melzi smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes .	815.5768142443576
 Leave me your address .	238.70010767115434
 I will send you the best the quarter has to offer .	399.06464215415866
 Michelangelo hurried to Sangallo 's solitary bachelor room with his sketches , asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated Madonna .	257.73912285096145
 Sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle couch .	178.78119538336398
 Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber .	1437.2595341902077
 Together he and Argiento built the stand , covering it with blankets .	365.1076678783223
 His first model arrived at dusk .	168.52970930252414
 He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to disrobe , so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins , led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes .	98.93799408868398
 He then draped him over the rough stand , explained that he was supposed to be recently dead , and was being held on his mother 's lap .	186.82950000768795
 The model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; only the instructions from his rabbi kept him from bolting .	336.97970388947124
 But at the end of the sitting , when Michelangelo showed him the quick , free drawings , with the mother roughed in , holding her son , the model grasped what Michelangelo was after , and promised to speak to his friends h. He worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi .	238.7086083274015
 Mary presented quite a different problem .	733.0519404332042
 Though this sculpture must take place thirty-three years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive of her as a woman in her mid-fifties , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry .	243.8992359864168
 His image of the Virgin had always been that of a young woman , even as had his memory of his mother .	136.92899023291432
 Jacopo Galli introduced him into several Roman homes .	270.4599909859565
 Here he sketched , sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk , young girls not yet twenty , some about to be married , some married a year or two .	339.3580051387851
 Since the Santo Spirito hospital had taken only men , he had had no experience in the study of female anatomy ; but he had sketched the women of Tuscany in their fields and homes .	98.27058525974374
 He was able to discern the body lines of the Roman women under their robes .	79.45711062170616
 He spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together a Mary who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; and a Jesus who , though lean , was strong even in death h a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of Santo Spirito .	394.66442724364884
 He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketches .	886.4827630548574
 Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay .	182.41509560307318
 Here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to distort forms .	172.8325197297576
 When he wanted to emphasize , or get greater intensity , he added or subtracted clay .	207.67517173298688
 Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence .	289.30089503345613
 He respected each of these approach techniques , and kept them in character his quill drawings had a scratchiness , suggesting skin texture ; the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an abdomen , in a reclining torso ; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull .	492.1257173479734
 Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; they remained rough starting points .	515.7390712154922
 When carving he was charged with spontaneous energy ; too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model .	316.1773904154892
 The true surge had to be inside the marble itself .	416.2333786758067
 Drawing and models were his thinking .	197.1310654607525
 Carving was action .	64.87154976744928
 10 .	1048.7454423000345
 The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice .	333.0091131147565
 Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal .	306.8126863426336
 Argiento , this is senseless , he complained , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather .	178.87441172060676
 You 're too clean .	476.56076801371006
 Scrub the studio once a week .	209.11040545936754
 That 's enough .	134.07876306937166
 No , said Argiento stolidly .	57.84504094452995
 Every day .	314.2473463065922
 Before dawn .	1061.5071765673536
 I was taught .	90.31631737213588
 And God help anyone who tries to unteach you !	605.5344078777997
 grumbled Michelangelo ; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble about , for Argiento made few demands on him .	155.37883959904332
 The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome .	331.7334760172224
 On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses .	193.1469167890471
 The one thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by announcing Today I go see the horses .	376.7189363014972
 It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him .	128.3062025084858
 He was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim , when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil .	176.01129395077177
 He stumbled into the house , eyes burning like fire .	363.33262655869606
 Argiento made him lie down on the bed , brought a pan of hot water , dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter .	249.9094732401491
 Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned .	131.99367892598352
 He assumed he could blink the splinter out .	51.30645691034773
 But it would not come .	32.30635970056579
 Argiento never left his side , keeping the water boiled , applying hot compresses throughout the night .	270.17436754704113
 By the second day Michelangelo began to worry ; and by the second night he was in a state of panic he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye .	172.4684724718384
 At dawn Argiento went to Jacopo Galli .	111.12830756603573
 Galli arrived with his family surgeon , Maestro Lippi .	142.06399704930857
 The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons .	142.42616058868313
 He told Argiento to take a bird out of the cage , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood gush into Michelangelo 's injured eye .	227.02153131688428
 The surgeon came back at dusk , cut the vein of a second pigeon , again washed out the eye .	99.88986785975155
 Beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps .	151.96491499775098
 The thin legs twitched convulsively once , then Kate felt the little body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound .	295.1339501555218
 The scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands .	1215.2411541697493
 The child was gone .	61.54001091267953
 When Juanita awoke , Kate was still rocking the dead child , still crooning in disbelief , No , no , oh , no !	358.2890985724015
 They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian minister .	441.1237826213357
 He sat beside Kate 's bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God 's will , while Kate lay staring angrily at him .	501.4776801893359
 When he told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words rebelliously .	185.20519588557073
 Few of the neighbors came , but Mrs Tussle came , called by tragedy .	204.14339284331632
 It always comes in threes , she sighed heavily .	245.67547519875896
 Trouble never comes but in threes .	128.3248498984643
 They held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot .	456.78375309223185
 Kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment .	190.15202495082613
 She would not accept the death of such a little child .	82.19491991455004
 God called her to Him , the minister had said .	249.90768322151442
 God would not do that , Kate thought stubbornly .	151.96819274377503
 Jonathan 's letter came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child 's death as another judgment from God against both Kate and himself .	204.39313825379804
 In blind panic of grief she accepted Jonathan 's dictum , and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by God .	297.6547274845772
 She held Jonathan 's letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed .	235.73825777680267
 She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son .	201.65882615882785
 Joel came and sat mutely with her , sharing her pain and anguish , averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom .	203.7972896993501
 Juanita and Mrs Tussle kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried .	751.9274842680103
 When she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty .	480.5530378277674
 She disciplined herself daily to do what must be done .	343.2167216816626
 She had even steeled herself to keep Juanita upstairs in the nurse 's room off the empty nursery , although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance of the baby 's death .	323.58472634784056
 Juanita drooped about the place , wearing a haunted , brooding look , which Kate attributed to the baby 's death , until the day a letter came for her addressed to Miss Juanita Fitzroy , bearing a Grafton postmark .	169.11709023843486
 Seeing the slanting hand , Kate knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel .	196.07911479523452
 The Federal forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving to take all the mountains .	121.82040255203952
 Kate tried to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended , at what involvement existed for Juanita .	263.9234083729933
 Uncle Randolph and Joel had replanted the bottom lands with difficulty , for more of the slaves , including Annie , had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp .	180.22252125478587
 Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school .	278.48501889335216
 He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry .	140.78318892670447
 Kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss .	253.32360124692568
 She loved him and missed his company .	226.69454831766456
 Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own .	429.59587764953966
 What it was Kate could not fathom .	162.07051720191308
 He claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his cronies , but Kate had not smelled brandy on him since Mrs Lattimer 's funeral .	235.15161927050926
 Joel knew what he was about , however .	58.98025948706382
 You 're gon na get caught , she heard Joel say to Uncle Randolph by the pump one morning .	311.3882894200415
 Not this old fox , chuckled Uncle Randolph .	262.53347286157964
 Everybody knows I 'm just a harmless , deaf old man who takes to drink .	530.2743908201355
 I aim to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure .	238.075926160348
 Whisky still , my foot , said Joel .	113.60177026611368
 You 're back there riding with the guerrillas , the Moccasin Rangers .	64.5133412826036
 Hush , said Uncle Randolph , smiling , or I 'll give you another black eye .	215.60006000020178
 He patted the eye Joel had had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads some days back .	233.64578399677805
 Kate had no idea what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night , had heard horsemen on the River Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn .	449.1056281436003
 Stranger , Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle , drunkenly singing Old Dan Tucker at the top of his voice .	217.82845230246159
 Hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road , Kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house , cold sober .	236.29592497505635
 What he was about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by General McClellan , threatening reprisals against Rebel guerrillas .	158.69161218486994
 She was taken up in worry for the reckless old man .	218.28428118253598
 Kate drew more and more on her affection for Joel through the hot days of summer work .	439.1956703911241
 She had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer , after she saw Miss Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom .	157.38966310531313
 Kate had walked past the school on her morning chores and had seen the whole incident , had seen Joel 's burning humiliation before Miss Snow 's cold , bespectacled wrath .	437.4346885835768
 He had the hardest pains of growing before him now , as he approached twelve .	325.30303559313955
 These would be his hardest years , she knew , and he missed his father desperately .	187.19357828826355
 She tried to find some way to draw him out , to help him .	86.74067861535019
 Whenever she found time , she went blackberry picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths purple , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day .	309.46872020684054
 He tended the new colts Beau had sired .	173.29860034751738
 He helped Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower garden in the side yard , where they sometimes sat in the still evenings watching the last fat bees working against the summer 's purple dusk .	721.527687524749
 No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph .	514.1479491354416
 They stayed in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the peddler , bringing the news .	167.41314305620185
 Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it ; of their first engagement at Falling Waters after Old Jack 's First Brigade had destroyed all the rolling stock of the BO Railroad .	464.4722298638627
 The men were restive , he wrote , ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished .	146.5254703721356
 The peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in Wheeling , Which had formed a new state government by declaring the government at Richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors .	216.98430945619592
 Dangling his gaudy trinkets before them , he told of the Rebel losses in the mountains , at Cheat and Rich mountains both , and the Federal march on Beverly .	103.82286541032539
 Cleaned all them Rebs out'n the hills , they did !	254.34938301734613
 They wo n't never git over inter loyal western Virginia , them traitors !	436.9071287253062
 The Federals is making everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too , he crowed .	191.96792455422298
 After he had gone , Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly , Would you take their oath ?	456.9749233503611
 And the old man had given a sly and wicked laugh and said , Hell , yes !	126.30462218013452
 I think I 've taken it about fifty times already !	534.9325197278715
 winking at Joel 's look of shock .	130.59814317400955
 Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate 's baby and at Jonathan 's decision to go with the South And , dear Kate , she wrote , poor Dr Breckenridge 's son Robert is now organizing a militia company to go South , to his good father 's sorrow .	593.939471378214
 Maj Anderson of Fort Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the US Army .	243.946029168825
 In spite of the fact that the state legislature voted us neutral , John Hunt Morgan is openly flying the Confederate flag over his woolen factory !	615.0723703069759
 Rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley .	189.94856899405423
 Accounts were garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg for the news .	193.4455939174879
 All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas Junction and it were a big fight , the old man told them .	123.17821014956313
 In the next few days they had cause to rejoice .	93.78099174961558
 It had been a big battle , and the Confederate forces had won .	131.06277940498495
 Jonathan and Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing .	136.89218498072393
 Kate and Mrs Tussle waited for letters anxiously .	520.5313985181658
 Joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate .	181.64210914726502
 When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful .	596.9188222019443
 They all prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come , for Virginia had defended her land victoriously .	371.6415104892064
 The week after Manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon 's rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window .	515.4205325099102
 They had already lost most of their corn , she thought .	181.47715229832383
 Were they to be insulted again because of the South 's great victory ?	138.9487228768649
 She remembered McClellan 's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs .	405.5033853384459
 At the landing she saw Juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door .	231.08245721850395
 Juanita stopped just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth .	289.9959418355444
 As Kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel Marsh framed in the doorway , his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita wore .	486.75734220071377
 Kate greeted him gravely , uneasy with misgivings at his visit .	682.7072351399723
 What brings you here again , Colonel Marsh ?	301.59156177209144
 she asked , taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun .	286.5205941659901
 I stopped to say goodbye , Mrs Lattimer , and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby .	129.72268820962344
 I wish our doctor could have saved her .	358.825855692451
 It was a terrible loss to me , said Kate quietly , feeling the pain twist again at the mention , knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at Grafton .	253.6967445805567
 Where will you go now that you 're leaving Parkersburg ?	335.63733229366574
 she asked him , seeing Juanita 's eyes grow bleak .	578.7792705752114
 As you know , General McClellan has been occupying Beverly .	605.4454058063048
 He has notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the Potomac .	66.97122887889145
 I am to go to Washington to serve with him .	79.88512923708025
 When are you to leave ?	223.51751021038393
 Kate asked , watching them both now anxiously .	420.58014919113316
 Their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions , she thought sadly .	645.2843403079911
 Tomorrow .	20.4452005901051
 Would you permit Juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell , Mrs Lattimer ?	245.88347138740318
 Stay here in the parlor where it 's cool , she said , trying to be calm .	131.25687150886176
 It would be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and Mrs Tussle not to see them .	81.68695915320176
 Kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations .	699.0165128794189
 Then she took iced lemonade to Marsh 's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden .	214.70966931445787
 When Marsh called to his aide and the pair rode off down the River Road where the gentians burned blue , Juanita was shaken and trying not to cry .	463.86171439849863
 She sought Kate out upstairs , her lips trembling .	1789.342579565728
 He wants me to go with him tomorrow , she told Kate .	242.01394019704256
 What do you want to do ?	103.3251980911175
 Kate asked , uneasy at the gravity of the girl 's dilemma .	344.19581077964756
 I could go with him .	37.559759748069624
 He knows me as your niece , which , of course , I am .	126.42457371755597
 But I am a slave !	161.0608342105674
 You own me .	479.11767597461983
 It 's your decision , said Juanita , holding her face very still , trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly .	291.6936838195897
 No , the decision is yours .	161.63977906614852
 I have held your papers of manumission since I married Mr Lattimer .	259.5560050015138
 The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky .	102.28356559433828
 The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no more .	253.6475819001406
 The things left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows .	196.7435184005961
 Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and then empty of images .	202.83723170699426
 They slept- Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring , the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table .	96.83866835328149
 In the ballroom below , the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows .	265.86177201572633
 It was a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky .	206.25443077845023
 Martha Schuyler , old , slow , careful of foot , came down the great staircase , dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk , her jeweled shoe buckles held forward .	234.68822663095347
 Well , I 'm here at last , she said , addressing the old portraits on the walls .	215.6205242758959
 I do n't hear the music .	59.83293084943398
 I am getting deaf , I must admit it .	283.48146407234503
 She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that led down to it .	124.41919055878124
 Where is everyone ?	595.3626248319677
 I say , where is everyone ?	192.22578267694925
 Peter , you lummox , you 've forgot to order the musicians .	223.94631738479205
 She stood there , a large old woman , smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning , this big foolish baby of a son .	213.91978275758927
 There were times now , like this , when she lost control of the time count and moved freely back and forth into three generations .	325.89380328390564
 Was it a birthday ball ?	1883.9349708768857
 When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen ?	657.9729111810318
 Or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big house , a Van Rensselaer bride from way upstate near Albany , from Rensselaerwyck .	320.31441432413743
 And this handsome booby , staring and sweating , was he her bridegroom ?	101.27292061331698
 Martha picked up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom .	302.2292942571701
 David Cortlandt was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh .	240.72388582927212
 He had ridden hard from Boston , and he was not used to horseback .	35.65770050884518
 Now , driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler , he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move .	337.027215574458
 The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather than the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood memories .	263.8581880504588
 He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held on as the sulky 's wheels hit a pothole and came out with a jolt and went on .	111.0343956202269
 He would cross to Manhattan , to Harlem Heights , before morning .	734.6981357118867
 There a certain farmhouse was a station for the Sons of Liberty .	185.0580225917556
 He would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news .	363.00988206136145
 And he would sleep , sleep , and never think of roads and horses ' sore haunches , of colonial wars .	314.2267070224497
 Strange how everything here fitted back into his life , even if he had been away so long .	140.08383458872132
 Mynheer , Sir Francis , the valley society , the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched road .	227.3652102342716
 A mist was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a blending and merging grace .	143.16840401005112
 Ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads .	233.16161778839054
 David reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags at his feet .	91.32427702888637
 He pulled out one of them and cocked it .	86.06634064363385
 A strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes .	858.9942934848561
 It was a grotesque hen , five or six feet tall .	642.8784261915407
 It had the features of a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers .	105.36793349983186
 It ran , this apocalyptic beast , on two thin legs , and its wings- were they feathered arms ? - flapped as it ran .	147.99035143824796
 Its groin was bloody .	26.713246741088522
 Black strips of skin hung from it .	1491.0771206385452
 The horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its nostrils .	83.67732535400242
 David took a firm hand with it .	289.05007393654716
 The creature in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes , glazed with an insane fear .	567.8887343907625
 The ungainly bird thing ran away , and to David its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster .	108.06796953648708
 Then it was gone .	48.7872650361189
 He drove on , wary and shaken .	210.6602556833472
 The Sons were out tonight .	464.20976078401253
 CHAPTER 10 New York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island .	359.4292050076579
 It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets , mostly around the Battery , going bravely north to Wall Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights .	377.39794778498367
 From there it looked across at Westchester County and the Hudson River where the manor houses , estates , and big farms of the original non-Indian landowners began .	145.0900196416786
 On the east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long Island Sound .	744.0141673722339
 On the western tip of Long Island protruded Brooklyn Heights .	879.0462647734314
 It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor .	570.6208104734168
 A fringe of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights , and behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields .	438.58190186321167
 Husbandry was bounded by snake-rail fences , and there were grazing cattle .	143.03235371864798
 On the shores north and south , the fishers and mooncursers- smugglers- lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand , Fire Island .	372.31697552039117
 The morning hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay , sheltered by the Jersey inlets .	153.50113871273834
 They often threw tidbits overboard .	485.02316371197156
 The larger ships were near Paulus Hook , already being called , by a few , Jersey City .	278.59312777896224
 These were the ships of His Majesty 's Navy , herding the hulks of the East Indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the loyalists .	67.95318325484925
 The news of battle on Breed 's Hill had already seeped through , and New York itself was now left in the hands of the local Provincial Congress .	166.67572937813554
 The fish hawk , his wings not moving , circled and glided lower .	134.4552875500802
 The gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him , the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black , the bronze cannon at the ports .	330.21808859298955
 The captain 's gig of HMS Mercury was being rowed to HMS Neptune .	34.70782209992783
 On shore the freed slaves to despotism- the town dwellers- watched the ships and waited .	521.5801523760209
 The chevaux de frise , those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the Battery , pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in .	192.79658989352038
 Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber ; their rock paths led down to the Hudson .	722.57438777441
 Below in the open bay facing Manhattan was Staten Island , gritty with clam shells and mud flats behind which nested farms , cattle barns , and berry thickets .	322.88906439654994
 Along Wappinger Creek in Dutchess County , past the white church at Fishkill , past Verplanck 's Point on the east bank of the Hudson , to the white salt-crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen .	282.9204730367806
 Today , tomorrow , six months , even perhaps a year h The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight .	400.5495922600944
 The British ships rolled at anchor , sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London .	1460.324855383304
 Waited for more ships , more lobster-backed infantry , and asked what was to be done with a war of rebellion ?	153.4405680330608
 David Cortlandt , having slept away a day and a night , came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem River near Spuyten Duyvil .	166.02059208302154
 He looked out through windowpanes turned a faint violet by sun and weather , looked out at King 's Bridge toward Westchester .	288.58876574127885
 The road seemed animated with a few more wagons than usual ; a carriage raising up the choking June dust , and beyond , in a meadow , a local militia company drilling with muskets , Kentuck ' rifles , every kind of horse pistol , old sword , or cutlass .	304.1862561454938
 The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded David 's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston .	338.8150143321853
 Pensive , introspective , he ached .	12.85955347338481
 He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept .	122.6067272750054
 Now there was more to do .	62.963751835642974
 Orders not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government .	251.4734147678257
 He scratched his mosquito-plagued neck .	51.04269370622415
 From the saddlebags , hung on a Hitchcock chair , David took out a good English razor , a present from John Hunter .	219.6878249292531
 He found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap , and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt , its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost h. He hoped he was free of self-deception .	147.63267548950333
 Here he was , suddenly caught up in the delirium of a war , in the spite and calumny of Whigs and Tories .	131.09172682883718
 There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war .	202.13708092277656
 David Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface .	180.45472364243986
 He knew that many were using it for their own ends .	139.26998903408122
 But it did not matter .	71.7115625973669
 He stropped the razor slowly ; what mattered was that a new concept of Americans was being born .	105.49910733424679
 That some men did not want it he could understand .	166.78876842342842
 The moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers .	254.43503894175169
 Yet some , like Morris Manderscheid , would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas .	140.6539758042969
 Unique circumstances would test us all , he decided .	243.61991286015802
 Injury and ingratitude would occur .	57.953702362177324
 No doubt John Hancock would do well now ; war was a smugglers ' heaven .	265.81476692192257
 And what of that poor tarred and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from Schuyler 's ?	134.04866690341174
 Things like that would increase rather than be done away with .	585.6937133609625
 One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing .	204.1599834975675
 He saw with John Hunter now that the perfectability of man was a dream .	134.5347155686668
 Life was a short play of tenebrous shadows .	210.9875902787259
 David began to shave with great sweeping strokes .	805.2534402906862
 Time plays an essential part in our mortality , and suddenly for no reason he could imagine or admit the image of Peg laughing filled his mind- so desirable , so lusty , so full of nuances of pleasure and joy .	474.7720309395623
 He drove sensual patterns off , carefully shaving his long upper lip .	413.8871571076805
 It is harder , he muttered , to meditate on man or woman than on God .	199.00967241135092
 David finished shaving , washed his face clean of lather , and combed and retied his hair .	146.86217374693186
 He was proud that he had never worn a wig .	62.75862309078243
 More and more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder .	304.7357760927555
 He felt cheerful again , refreshed ; presentable in his wide-cut brown suit , the well-made riding boots .	210.94705127989616
 It is so easy to falsify sentiment h. In the meadow below , militia officers shouted at their men and on King 's Bridge two boys sat fishing .	703.3514236602746
 The future would happen ; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much .	222.5887596451625
 A man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days .	421.92169873925985
 He began to pack the saddlebags .	63.62887560795118
 And all this too shall pass away it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy- yes , in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal Hudson Valley , where a feeling of plenitude was normal in those English-Dutch manors with their well-fed squires .	191.93166681799903
 Burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on in a primitive way , almost unchanged from feudal times .	464.0604922563762
 Peasants puzzled Andrei .	125.94567037092924
 He wondered how they could go on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish .	340.85554553128463
 Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long ago .	273.6683585560335
 Tolek Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine and , before the national leadership , exalted the miracles of drying up swamps and irrigating the desert .	108.637003008231
 A fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched .	487.26108165788094
 Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference .	158.412623528376
 Had he found the meaning too late ?	513.1761875390524
 It aggravated him .	20.477518916112956
 The land of the Lublin Uplands was rich , but no one seemed to care .	71.17689745195594
 In the unfertile land in Palestine humans broke their backs pushing will power to the brink .	330.00027849093993
 He had sat beside Alexander Brandel at the rostrum of a congress of Zionists .	42.87778373283398
 All of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified ideologies , and each berated the other and beat his breast for his own approaches .	247.70618887037537
 When Alexander Brandel rose to speak , the hall became silent .	261.9080474489717
 I do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism .	245.25135096793102
 We are here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest , seeking human dignity .	1098.8802315955597
 Beyond the forest all our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren , eroded hills of Judea .	366.3532777228652
 This is our singular goal .	283.8843961858278
 How we travel through the forest is for each man 's conscience .	359.3910180796176
 Where we end our journey is always the same .	438.6438754769565
 We all seek the same thing through different ways- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over Zion .	432.71551183741576
 This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism .	290.7890395052983
 It had sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it .	57.48361203620845
 In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine .	61.27054908401977
 He loathed the idea of drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright .	67.11253865180407
 Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex , I only want to be a Pole .	81.11153130469552
 Warsaw is my city , not Tel Aviv .	53.94650111013731
 And now Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief .	129.37752061123064
 Warsaw !	43.70632064286005
 He saw the smug eyes of the Home Army chief , Roman , and all the Romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him .	199.97640033640155
 They had let this black hole of death in Warsaw 's heart exist without a cry of protest .	382.67256988057534
 Once there had been big glittering rooms where Ulanys bowed and kissed the ladies ' hands as they flirted from behind their fans .	292.6129171191242
 Warsaw !	44.55572658226148
 Warsaw !	43.41944132216171
 Miss Rak .	68.61896548483183
 I am a Jew .	94.67261638531866
 Day by day , week by week , month by month , the betrayal gnawed at Andrei 's heart .	383.7357273527842
 He ground his teeth together .	404.05632889908566
 I hate Warsaw , he said to himself .	57.79326400963424
 I hate Poland and all the goddamned mothers ' sons of them .	332.60561169739634
 All of Poland is a coffin .	82.44309636024389
 The terrible vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind .	619.249452350715
 What matters now ?	588.4384126709095
 What is beyond this fog ?	352.41899730907073
 Only Palestine , and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe .	67.6017118267668
 By late afternoon the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at Lublin , which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the Russian front .	190.61105749337338
 At a siding , another train which was a familiar sight these days .	446.0757900106682
 Deportees .	20.82228244772876
 Jews .	3653.6461012843547
 Andrei 's skilled eye sized them up .	153.37721553690642
 They were not Poles .	24.1403976250985
 He guessed by their appearance that they were Rumanians .	59.595913099909936
 He walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka .	50.438026372606465
 Of all the places in Poland , Andrei hated Lublin the most .	197.09686868668373
 The Bathyrans were all gone .	79.20155081681406
 Few of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto .	231.72429419420905
 From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point .	126.37721618106062
 He and Ana watched it carefully .	186.5172294628105
 Lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere .	104.81067684237675
 Early in 1939 , Odilo Globocnik , the Gauleiter of Vienna , established SS headquarters for all of Poland .	248.533208047666
 The Bathyrans ran a check on Globocnik and had only to conclude that he was in a tug of war with Hans Frank and the civilian administrators .	161.90311780521486
 Globocnik built the Death's-Head Corps .	81.31813523445884
 Lublin was the seed of action for the final solution of the Jewish problem .	108.55202904364208
 As the messages from Himmler , Heydrich , and Eichmann came in through Alfred Funk , Lublin 's fountainhead spouted .	70.27440394448831
 A bevy of interlacing lagers , work camps , concentration camps erupted in the area .	185.69034407017287
 Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners of war disappeared into Lublin 's web .	340.78942626557455
 Plans went in and out of Lublin , indicating German confusion .	384.61497691928616
 A tale of a massive reservation in the Uplands to hold several million Jews h A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to the island of Madagascar h Stories of the depravity of the guards at Globocnik 's camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention of their names .	264.8464285635385
 Lipowa 7 , Sobibor , Chelmno , Poltawa , Belzec , Krzywy-Rog , Budzyn , Krasnik .	8.078752266579476
 Ice baths , electric shocks , lashings , wild dogs , testicle crushers .	39.208706933547035
 The Death's-Head Corps took in Ukrainian and Baltic Auxiliaries , and the Einsatzkommandos waded knee-deep in blood and turned into drunken , dope-ridden maniacs .	32.0586386236193
 Lublin was their heart .	58.25100248124301
 In the spring of 1942 Operation Reinhard began in Lublin .	206.10787754138596
 The ghetto , a miniature of Warsaw 's , was emptied into the camp in the Majdan-Tartarski suburb called Majdanek .	176.15574039013904
 As the camp emptied , it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around Lublin , then by deportees from outside Poland .	123.3740195842364
 In and in and in they poured through the gates of Majdanek , but they never left , and Majdanek was not growing any larger .	184.27698661569755
 What was happening in Majdanek ?	101.15752678964778
 Was Operation Reinhard the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw ?	337.3177323814465
 Was there another Majdanek in the Warsaw area , as they suspected ?	127.55580170266492
 Andrei stopped at Litowski Place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings .	313.5849108658302
 His watch told him he was still early .	247.2152701165032
 Down the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall .	158.3918302735903
 He found an empty bench , opened a newspaper , and stretched his legs before him .	314.0649836193351
 Krakow Boulevard was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their Auxiliaries .	225.89260905622515
 Captain Androfski !	438.5363362129845
 Andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the mustached , homely face of Sergeant Styka .	89.86186591006825
 Styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly .	104.52293204313622
 I have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn .	307.37811277861556
 I thought you might get in on a morning train .	192.53117253928636
 It 's good to see you again , Styka .	72.01807269718866
 Styka studied his captain .	203.8566809093133
 He almost broke into tears .	694.4789429126135
 To him , Andrei Androfski had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer .	125.40840169452663
 His captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby .	318.11782013851825
 Remember to call me Jan , Andrei said .	352.94679990944843
 Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously .	75.34750445861027
 When that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy since before the war .	302.8178319768744
 I 'm lucky that you were still living in Lublin .	134.8647524038402
 Styka grumbled about fate .	142.27041039944535
 For a time I thought of trying to reach the Free Polish Forces , but one thing led to another .	247.95106569912275
 I got a girl in trouble and we had to get married .	164.8777209866975
 Not a bad girl .	319.70383846978325
 So we have three children and responsibilities .	317.03268236123523
 I work at the granary .	30.775270080096654
 Nothing like the old days in the army , but I get by .	131.48084358946258
 Who complains ?	213.12721953050445
 Many times I tried to reach you , but I never knew how .	170.6744203798676
 I came to Warsaw twice , but there was that damned ghetto wall h I understand .	178.39386341926678
 Styka blew his nose again .	95.89902459455237
 Were you able to make the arrangements ?	144.0340912635013
 Andrei asked .	65.59108961174168
 There is a man named Grabski who is the foreman in charge of the bricklayers at Majdanek .	85.99187961732501
 I did exactly as instructed .	302.4042630997925
 I told him you are on orders from the Home Army to get inside Majdanek so you can make a report to the government in exile in London .	197.63013517700907
 His answer ?	336.9035065286818
 Ten thousand zlotys .	332.96041218868885
 Can he be trusted ?	1073.117760702553
 He is aware he will not live for twenty-four hours if he betrays you .	223.8472702518692
 Good man , Styka .	87.55540333597486
 Captain h Jan h must you go inside Majdanek ?	1243.9864884994695
 The stories h Everyone really knows what is happening there .	910.0111749766872
 Not everyone , Styka .	89.35602117371462
 What good will it really do ?	763.6330392658684
 I do n't know .	40.218663076839455
 Perhaps h perhaps h there is a shred of conscience left in the human race .	182.05317158643962
 Perhaps if they know the story there will be a massive cry of indignation .	129.16289974369974
 Do you really believe that , Jan ?	447.72480182294976
 I have to believe it .	60.02559539657908
 Styka shook his head slowly .	234.06207897343364
 I am only a simple soldier .	131.49937448718518
 I can not think things out too well .	164.71806849246056
 Until I was transferred into the Seventh Ulanys I was like every other Pole in my feeling about Jews .	240.5345416434814
 I hated you when I first came in .	345.29736778565166
 But h my captain might have been a Jew , but he was n't a Jew .	103.58645025047268
 What I mean is , he was a Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys .	51.4768243449224
 Hell , sir .	73.62083629249574
 The men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name .	508.3644217922525
 You never knew about it , but by God , we taught them respect for Captain Androfski .	176.94796794537336
 Andrei smiled .	141.28773283340476
 Since the war I have seen the way the Germans have behaved and I think , Holy Mother , we have behaved like this for hundreds of years .	400.20270599523445
 Why ?	419.44004196380695
 How can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see ?	440.3240468106239
 But we are neither blind nor insane .	887.9298481799199
 The men of your company would not allow your name dishonored .	139.04248465813362
 Why do we let the Germans do this ?	597.723105193762
 I have sat many hours with this , Styka .	128.76852922996852
 All I ever wanted was to be a free man in my own country .	161.79674054067627
 I 've lost faith , Styka .	168.31969374833767
 I used to love this country and believe that someday we 'd win our battle for equality .	362.69482016684884
 But now I think I hate it very much .	210.14616298537112
 And do you really think that the world outside Poland will care any more than we do ?	448.04346646092654
 The question frightened Andrei .	315.46944768622757
 Please do n't go inside Majdanek .	102.14710664310422
 I 'm still a soldier in a very small way , Styka .	99.03390230181716
 It was an answer that Styka understood .	76.61483463400974
 Grabski 's shanty was beyond the bridge over the River Bystrzyca near the rail center .	148.08079615830263
 Grabski sat in a sweat-saturated undershirt , cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown .	149.91988201136587
 He was a square brick of a man with a moon-round face and sunken Polish features .	153.15838162565876
 Flies swarmed around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread .	146.98692249537936
 Half of it dripped down his chin .	225.85863481891283
 He washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch .	117.86437451961949
 Well ?	475.38365539776214
 Andrei demanded .	115.72314823434567
 Grabski looked at the pair of them .	52.957999711585444
 He grunted a sort of yes answer .	164.09745142496976
 My cousin works at the Labor Bureau .	812.0273804126385
 He can make you work papers .	199.3473927631286
 It will take a few days .	59.813489181492066
 I will get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew .	240.60091384789627
 I do n't know if I can get you into the inner camp .	102.35763426939312
 Maybe yes , maybe no , but you can observe everything from the roof of a barrack we are building .	242.51232545944137
 Grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup bowl .	88.12242814913559
 Ca n't understand why the hell anyone wants to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place .	363.1270039364495
 Orders from the Home Army .	172.0373042787049
 Why ?	423.056519627173
 Nothing there but Jews .	1112.6974033555277
 Andrei shrugged .	12.940080441948579
 We get strange orders .	518.228240948321
 Well- what about the money ?	137.77402399363248
 Andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty notes .	123.5423849241786
 Grabski had never seen so much money .	134.24095943179873
 His broad flat fingers , petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying , snatched the bills clumsily .	299.15358132436893
 This ai n't enough .	373.6136877310024
 You get the rest when I 'm safely out of Majdanek .	127.05229002497795
 I ai n't taking no goddamned chances for no Jew business .	534.5218690285404
 Andrei and Styka were silent .	65.42546786237406
 She was getting real dramatic .	518.516157415032
 I 'd have been more impressed if I had n't remembered that she 'd played Hedda Gabler in her highschool dramatics course .	137.11174504803742
 I did n't want her back on that broken record .	205.50516673383734
 Nothing 's free in the whole goddam world , was all I could think of to say .	126.34414250399286
 When I 'd delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink .	295.02301828517614
 I am , she said .	61.52713208756849
 I 'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky Derby and how it was Thelma 's fifty dollars I was spending .	221.89951545461014
 It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days , and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch .	285.7062354633337
 Drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me .	215.37207732415314
 I was crazy about her all over again .	251.41294314075205
 It was the call of the wild all right .	116.4441133847966
 That evening turned out to be hell like all the others .	208.8660427901743
 We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill .	130.15204708471222
 It was the same old routine .	88.07062962051417
 Eileen got to dancing , just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed tune that you could hardly notice , and trying to pick up strange men , but each time I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she 'd pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet husky voice about the good times and the happiness we 'd had together and there I was back on the hook .	298.08031643674667
 I did have the decency to call up Thelma and tell her I 'd met old friends and would be home late .	355.6579990521979
 I could scratch her eyes out , Eileen cried and stamped her foot when I came back from the phone booth .	256.40368143619753
 You know I do n't like my men to have other women .	175.11455628099714
 I hate it .	118.31708747792281
 I hate it .	117.73487877971898
 She got so drunk I had to take her home .	213.91616348538608
 It was a walk up on Hudson Street .	204.47882541758196
 She just about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and would n't let me go .	533.3958983848761
 There was a man 's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table .	171.44381968009208
 The place smelt of some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use .	217.54833871955088
 What about Ballestre ?	156.66474192791907
 I had to shake her to make her listen .	194.11204848154497
 Precious .	21.28567276064565
 What about him ?	164.83985486763123
 Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic .	457.58098913985964
 Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom .	458.5462847040682
 We are above being jealous .	124.01332544841243
 He 's used to me bringing home strange men .	465.9211835961868
 I 'll just tell him you 're my husband .	327.56280679122
 He ca n't object to that .	132.92514814259349
 Well I object .	932.705898672791
 If he pokes his nose in here I 'll slug him .	272.83421396614915
 That really would be funny .	214.39160959092231
 She began to laugh .	299.57660125611045
 She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed .	452.78666197810634
 After all I 'm made of flesh and blood .	329.1963308706993
 I 'm not a plaster saint .	277.0758521936593
 Waking up was horrible .	210.01586950154166
 Never in my life have I felt so remorseful about anything I 've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife .	361.4029229365265
 We both had hangovers .	141.24137297733145
 Eileen declared she could n't lift her head from the pillow .	128.8908857435745
 She lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot .	305.5813985290755
 I was stumbling in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when I smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell .	147.12708806712357
 There was somebody else in the apartment .	119.42232297132229
 I stiffened .	33.80620102633061
 Honest I could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a dog 's that is going to get into a fight .	176.13200363619404
 I turned around with the percolator in my hand .	71.60233028552679
 My eyes were so bleary I could barely see him but there he was , a little smooth olivefaced guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora .	164.0186926931324
 Brown eyes , eyebrow mustache .	120.71583077299906
 Oval face without an expression in the world .	126.49699285521608
 We did n't have time to speak before Eileen 's voice was screeching at us from the bed .	92.50214726843032
 Joseph Maria Ballestre meet Francis Xavier Bowman .	746.4114478091177
 Exboyfriend meet exhusband .	91.31390509227944
 She gave the nastiest laugh I ever heard .	281.15057284517695
 And do n't either of you forget that I 'm not any man 's property .	277.15458856638105
 If you want to fight , go down on the sidewalk .	118.26127469051279
 She was enjoying the situation .	155.88960677833902
 Imagine that .	79.84678055753061
 Eileen was a psychologist all right .	191.53666697701348
 Instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard I found myself having a fellowfeeling for him .	289.07364002444325
 Maybe he felt the same way .	70.46016277291335
 I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life .	64.18006482694949
 First thing I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and I was handing Eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers .	204.36963463559204
 I could n't face Thelma after that night .	130.61372672800996
 I did n't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone .	221.88519488802118
 I wrote her that I 'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express .	396.9473298211819
 Of course I had to give her Eileen 's address , but she never came near us .	122.58326600015342
 All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever .	390.86987664125843
 She never said a word about the fifty dollars .	233.39673231250592
 She added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking .	485.6424835193874
 I must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times .	178.79222855766943
 Afterwards I learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband away .	141.88121026896744
 That finished me with Thelma .	101.01609747246786
 Trust Eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation .	113.72258635014458
 And there I was shacked up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street .	295.9700475236324
 I use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship .	449.4523774862442
 I felt it and it ate on me all the time , but I did n't know how right I was till later .	151.45994334463742
 What I did know was that Precious was always around .	105.05769479290117
 He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs .	145.75954538472067
 Who do you think pays the rent ?	1230.0022334125408
 You would n't have me throw the poor boy out on the street , Eileen said when I needled her about it .	146.64840312218374
 I said sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention .	224.87780706354047
 Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening to things she did n't want to hear .	190.4291399482692
 Still I did n't think she was twotiming me with Precious right then .	149.46834183258937
 To be on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night .	346.5931936537857
 Precious had me worried .	177.4573656586863
 I could n't make out what his racket was .	60.60109966338919
 I 'd thought him a pimp or procurer but he did n't seem to be .	53.340232886204426
 He was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his selfeffacing manner .	297.7214578220481
 Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet .	143.90263906074884
 Whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious who did the work .	257.26468147259806
 I never could find out what his business was .	137.9328406794882
 He always seemed to have money in his pocket .	126.26324910602126
 The phone had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger .	175.87165214025893
 Now and then he would disappear for several days .	216.6576128198695
 Connections was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions .	510.43159291697765
 Oh he 's just an international spy , Eileen would shout with her screechy laugh .	277.12773316341566
 Poor devil he ca n't have been too happy either .	544.2431504447003
 He got no relief from drink because , though sometimes Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening , he 'd leave it on the table untouched .	247.7444466475018
 When I was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess .	673.7865945709456
 Occasionally if I pushed him too far he 'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his .	773.6743892302114
 Some day , I told Eileen , that guy will kill us both .	259.04660701379544
 She just would n't listen .	249.5339775669983
 Getting drunk every night was the only way I could handle the situation .	342.06949460601203
 Eileen seemed to feel the same way .	61.905124022373144
 We still had that much in common .	187.04659046749296
 The trouble was drinking cost money .	565.054868366657
 The way Eileen and I were hitting it up , we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening .	412.6891296989942
 Eileen must have wheedled a little out of Precious .	45.762007996538436
 I raised some kale by hocking the good clothes I had left over from my respectable uptown life , but when that was gone I did n't have a cent .	168.6933858296321
 I do n't know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer had n't come to town .	125.62185400656166
 Pat O'Dwyer looked like a heavier Jim .	1058.6725695294322
 He had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he did n't have Jim 's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm .	257.95719992363735
 He was a big thick beefy violent man .	236.36758777187322
 Now Pat may have been a lecher and a plugugly , but he was a good churchgoing Catholic and he loved his little sister .	97.68155412899127
 Those O'Dwyers had that Irish clannishness that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything .	305.5836050191649
 Pat took Eileen and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again .	244.31774584214932
 Whom God hath joined etcetera .	663.5070114409183
 The O'Dwyers were real religious people except for Kate .	411.65850257967355
 Now it would be up to me to keep the little girl out of mischief .	121.65319681180637
 Pat had been worried as hell ever since she 'd lost her job on that fashion magazine .	1141.6212348622194
 It had gone big with the Hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of Art and Apparel .	262.52500921670713
 How about me trying to help her get her job back ?	501.1974661070777
 All evening Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion .	375.08649400973974
 It just about blew us both out of the water when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with .	179.85482461846638
 But brother I ca n't take a job right now , she said with her eyes on her ice cream , I 'm going to have a baby , Francis Xavier 's baby , my own husband 's baby .	299.65447155738383
 My first thought was how had it happened so soon , but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we 'd been living together six weeks .	462.4162587014819
 Pat meanwhile was bubbling over with sentiment .	614.8342220384404
 Greatest thing that ever happened .	284.58711538240783
 Now Eileen really would have to settle down to love honor and obey , and she 'd have to quit drinking .	476.77154136688415
 He 'd come East for the christening , by God he would .	142.07021944022412
 When we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into Eileen 's hand to help towards a layette .	599.4331342805857
 Before he left town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job .	259.3374300650879
 Pat had contacts all over the labor movement .	597.1410513881578
 A friend of Pat 's named Frank Sposato had just muscled into the Portwatchers ' Union .	198.46793186307394
 The portwatchers were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves .	69.6153364316399
 Most of them were elderly men .	403.85801274945896
 It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of New York .	204.3534203227154
 They were n't as well paid as they should have been .	107.67569927690114
 One reason the portwatchers let Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen .	121.93731836920689
 Sposato needed a front , some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the Redhook local .	448.1170151029886
 There I was a retired wobbly and structural iron worker who 'd never gouged a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement .	313.054603315053
 For once radicalism was a recommendation .	111.01535679008731
 Sposato could n't wait to get me hired .	173.7223614893438
 With my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked the honest working stiff .	579.6051529611169
 The things a man will do for a woman .	125.95886638339016
 There was one fact which Rector could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny .	151.20171205775333
 As long as there were two human beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave .	233.73193400990988
 No matter how devoted a man was , no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord , he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual .	275.13661613833415
 All of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord 's servants .	100.80121245794574
 It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions .	132.9644255106456
 Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church- his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel .	185.51390255292714
 He was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego , demanding to be satisfied , for the two were intertwined and could not be separated .	137.13621503789687
 He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated , the Communists in the village rooted out , the mission standing triumphant , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant , too .	205.15705249280472
 But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan , that man 's ambition when linked with God would be a driving , indefatigable force for good in the world .	184.8624834279675
 He sighed .	295.5300528238254
 How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice .	196.51464735768815
 He would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought about , would be sweet indeed .	252.18068838577943
 His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days .	134.99448955830914
 His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print shop , using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse .	198.0939960540228
 In any event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked , telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what Kayabashi was planning .	187.05729927456053
 Hino was elated at the prospect .	33.33370411202943
 He was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor- an excellent place to make contact with the enemy .	153.6245126031639
 He left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday , nodding attentively as Rector gave him his final instructions .	126.36596036403348
 He was to get involved in no arguments ; he was to try to make no converts ; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard .	116.5415814077755
 It was a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it , for Hino , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage agent .	232.41222196519823
 If he wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection .	105.04348938792953
 In all of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino .	206.36538754282802
 From the moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job , any job- his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise hand- he had been ready to become a Christian .	178.79981162102862
 He had already been studying the Bible ; he knew the fundamentals , and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector , announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that .	133.70947019968267
 Rector had never been able to find out much about Hino 's past .	84.08208939731912
 Hino talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject .	306.3303100800882
 Putting the pieces of this mosaic together , Rector had the vague outlines of a biography .	74.44550578333134
 Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in Chiba , and divided his life between the land and the sea , supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat .	258.0037480137768
 Without exception Hino 's brothers turned to either one or both of their father 's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller .	463.40512891013657
 He had gone into the Japanese navy , had been trained as an officer , had participated in one or two battles- he never went into detail regarding his military experience- and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out of the blue , he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian .	187.1722815309008
 Rector was often curious ; often tempted to ask questions but he never did .	474.2540835710141
 If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so unasked .	85.5286614386803
 Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellished with his active imagnation .	109.24981725647886
 When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village , Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return , for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector 's office rarely rang unless it was important .	115.86993726180967
 He was surprised to find Kayabashi 's secretary on the other end of the line .	72.3029830049841
 He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted .	73.87211837942579
 The oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries , the secretary said , businessmen from Tokyo for the most part , and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission .	135.86691332588586
 They had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it .	173.81658333398047
 Oh ?	528.3538298715083
 Rector said .	40.28172179372259
 I guess it will be all right .	156.8895460712893
 When would the oyabun like to bring his guests up here ?	214.2411584697138
 This afternoon , the secretary said .	233.6076955289064
 At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time .	228.25484653077572
 All right , Rector said .	82.5425392708393
 I will be expecting them .	102.46617384698148
 He was about to hang up the phone , but a note of hesitancy in the secretary 's voice left the conversation open .	155.16572392167188
 He had something more to say .	57.26375305849089
 I beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers , he said .	352.6280831697065
 Rector laughed despite himself .	558.8619871983313
 Unless the oyabun has been working on it , he said , then checked himself and added You can tell Kayabashi-san that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use .	194.24033995474107
 Arigato gosaimasu .	12.82657836770343
 The secretary sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in Rector 's hand .	214.36954125606744
 Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission .	201.41403862078255
 For the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it was probably the latter .	224.38957919951162
 Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village .	149.10447812299392
 At the same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity .	214.85919512707002
 No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived .	148.20143864585276
 When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds .	217.9052964869902
 Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn .	119.44522617346493
 Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .	126.90361865286567
 A good initial impression would be important now .	263.27973501611103
 He went into the print shop , where Fletcher had just finished cleaning the press .	247.62542544826698
 How many pamphlets do we have in stock ?	706.2875109345285
 Rector said .	40.34242344830158
 I should say about a hundred thousand , Fletcher said .	105.69108633504968
 Why ?	423.61277897298135
 I would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon , Rector said , He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create , the picture of a very busy mission .	184.2066083938762
 He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly , just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner .	205.36375897820128
 Fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things Rector requested .	282.8081343494297
 Rector 's next stop was at the schoolroom , where Mavis was monitoring a test .	119.49979068229214
 He beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside .	221.21958850026783
 He told her of the visitors and then of his plans .	128.0166018128437
 How many children do you have present today ?	496.54566524711265
 he said .	68.67792918593881
 She looked back toward the schoolroom .	60.29633094044916
 Fifteen , she said .	142.69430713172585
 No , only fourteen .	579.2170026825565
 The little Ito girl had to go home .	113.24328570550702
 She has a pretty bad cold .	489.533056567107
 I would like them to appear very busy today , not busy exactly , but joyous , exuberant , full of life .	241.7602490067113
 I want to create the impression of a compound full of children .	155.70743940491042
 Do you think you can manage it ?	314.95834166138474
 Mavis smiled .	150.19818903482974
 I 'll try .	137.03996054785264
 As Rector was walking back toward the residential hall , Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him .	205.70062834051413
 The altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen his spirits , but he was still a little wary around Rector for they had not yet discussed the incident .	93.03686276109852
 I think I 've fixed the pump so we wo n't have to worry about it for a long time , he said .	219.5274401268391
 I 've adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water gets too low .	671.4742508668427
 Fine , Rector said .	317.04102694387444
 He looked out over the expanse of the compound .	40.471632236874385
 It was going to take a lot of activity to fill it .	70.5951406801714
 Have you ever operated a transit ?	989.9084070265575
 he said .	67.7344639918659
 No , sir , Johnson said .	249.23558795370488
 You are about to become a first-class surveyor , Rector said .	94.30583417331962
 When Konishi gets back with the jeep , I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys .	234.9869194366461
 Konishi can help you .	167.46294649564277
 You 'll find an old transit in the basement .	191.7473032060145
 The glass is out of it , but that wo n't matter .	133.92009178838276
 It looks pretty efficient and that 's the important thing .	499.06366579357797
 He went on to explain what he had in mind .	90.8721267817814
 Johnson nodded .	2626.2994738821153
 He said he could do it .	41.14412860154626
 Rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall .	215.34756396453074
 It was rather a childish game , all in all , but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much .	161.30838357667642
 He was not sure what effect it would have , but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it .	141.82450603157443
 He was not going to lose the mission by default , and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission , he was going to be in for a surprise .	109.27442998917472
 He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall , and then to take charge of the office while the party was here .	195.31578341141775
 When everything had been done , Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock .	288.21151429152127
 At two thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi 's party .	147.23868993364204
 Then Rector , attired in his best blue serge suit , sat in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoking a cigarette and waiting .	140.73544251656634
 The air was cooler here , and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass , an effect which he found pleasant .	204.41233752596344
 She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient .	500.633432765547
 The fish took the bait .	102.0237697393586
 He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but- joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned .	194.25561658643952
 But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement .	129.08222956780523
 She was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed .	141.02034914375565
 Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose .	339.46198505395074
 She wrote again and now , abandoning for the moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career .	157.1128183593852
 She could act and she could write .	165.33973802111763
 His lordship was concerned in the management of Drury Lane but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and criticize her novel ?	151.2848855413257
 At last he consented to meet her , and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal Have you any objection to the following plan ?	645.0102501756854
 On Thursday evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles .	463.5174051570528
 There we shall be free and unknown ; we can return the following morning h She concluded by asking for a brief interview- to settle with you where- and she threw in a tribute to his gentle manners and the wild originality of your countenance .	331.7431724009847
 She opened his reply with trembling fingers h he agreed !	962.4538617080852
 And he would see her that evening .	154.84102279495647
 Victory at last !	3809.5884089641418
 At their meeting he told her not to bother about where- he would attend to that .	241.95317316003806
 There was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and , as Claire rose to go , he asked her to sing him one song before she left .	114.12032259591884
 She sang him Scott 's charming ballad Rosabelle , which was the vogue of the moment .	143.11832950300985
 She had never sung better .	302.9194532973109
 Your voice is delightful , he approved with a warm smile .	510.20334208824977
 Tomorrow will be a new experience- I have never before made love to a nightingale h. There have been cooing doves , chattering magpies , thieving jackdaws , a proud peacock , a silly goose , and a harpy eagle- whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals .	130.7832723490121
 And so they went , he choosing of all places an inn near Medmenham Abbey , scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the Hellfire Club .	188.8121303571967
 He regaled Claire with an account of the mock mass performed by the cassocked bloods , which he had had at firsthand from old Bud Dodington , one of the leaders of the so-called Order .	111.11483837203876
 Each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this , it seems , was not employed for self-flagellation h. Naked girls danced in the chancel of the Abbey , the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities .	222.2367093098136
 The jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish .	64.66676548549944
 Alas , all that belonged to the age of Devil Dashwood and Wicked Wilkes , abbot and beadsman of the Order !	40.198012580223065
 The casual seduction of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison .	76.70715107962143
 They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate .	107.66519652651813
 A scant half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace , the air about them scented with stock , and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden .	251.1259346040808
 Charming and peaceful- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure ?	453.5217301859404
 Alone with the fabulous Byron !	551.7114615095104
 How many women had longed for the privilege that was hers .	185.37033816840483
 How was she to behave , Claire wondered .	219.26986130929936
 To be passive , to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd .	290.22053979614236
 She was the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare 's poem .	246.10141692352747
 And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience , satiety might well be an equal handicap .	200.18646748021044
 No , she would not pretend modesty , but neither must she be crudely bold .	118.81382036379365
 Mystery- that was the thing .	47.58691116641558
 In the bedroom she would insist on darkness .	314.98934638186125
 With his club foot he might well be grateful .	634.3358124820431
 At the inn , which was situated close to a broad weir , Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference and addressed as milord .	89.43421487475568
 The place was evidently a familiar haunt and Claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown .	241.06619641307742
 The fire in the sitting room was lighted .	236.7003522702595
 What about the bedroom ?	261.67167316031635
 Byron inquired .	3770.873705613925
 Seems to me last time I was here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell .	226.18020554412647
 We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney , milord , but I promise you you 'll never have trouble of that sort again .	202.14082421420153
 So , not only had he been here before , but it seemed he might well come again .	147.47432186563765
 Claire felt suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan .	207.81414049464234
 A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port .	488.0868547518732
 When Napoleon 's ship had borne him to Elba , French wines had started to cross the Channel , the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years , but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled .	329.4169617235639
 As they waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in hand , while Byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers .	312.1136316119008
 Sex is overpriced , he said .	23.517018226895086
 The great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against Fate , not man against man for the prize of a woman 's body .	252.05862995069091
 So do n't see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance .	400.7555643660942
 The gods seemed to think sex pretty important , she rebutted .	316.6709253693441
 Mars and Venus , Bacchus and Ariadne , Jupiter and Io , Byron and the nymph of the owl 's nest .	92.86014126275309
 That would be Minerva , I suppose .	41.032182621510344
 Was n't the owl her symbol ?	532.3589950661623
 Byron laughed .	2280.661709904535
 So you know something of the classics , do you ?	239.86001372219
 Tell me about Minerva , how she behaved , what she did to please you .	169.33852087626414
 I 'll tell you nothing .	155.56819319645638
 I do n't ask you who 't is you 're being unfaithful to , husband or lover .	388.72535015772195
 Frankly , I do n't care .	37.79987871986214
 For a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity , who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind .	263.5329567532032
 Very well , she said , I 'll not catechize you .	86.67617428719493
 What matter the others so long as I have my place in history .	278.06506504656255
 She was striking the right note .	321.0196566064902
 No man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed , with one so favored , flattery could hardly seem overdone .	217.3145882457761
 Brains and beauty , high position in both the social and intellectual worlds , athlete , fabled lover- if ever the world was any man 's oyster it was his .	250.9553166202363
 The light supper over , Claire went to him and , slipping an arm about his shoulder , sat on his knee .	202.51164349961059
 He drew her close and , hand on cheek , turned her face to his .	421.72160834232244
 Her lips , moist and parted , spoke his name .	258.7082623054025
 Byron !	6317.5501468845405
 His hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown ; then , to better purpose , he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers , untied it .	126.68833220951164
 The bodice beneath was buttoned and , withdrawing his lips from hers , he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it , unhurriedly as if she were a child .	79.49034139847839
 But , kindled by his kiss , his caressing hand , her desire was aflame .	49.83923638161021
 She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom .	388.53463918234655
 Lord Byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color .	1106.3246970354294
 He drank slowly with due appreciation .	355.6723119095103
 It was an excellent vintage .	38.372066808541476
 He rose and went to the bedroom .	104.8799826735233
 Pausing in the doorway he said The form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , is the most challenging loveliness in all nature .	149.31404593507298
 When Claire returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become Byron 's mistress .	194.84111167686015
 By odd coincidence , on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read Parisina , which was the latest of the titled poet 's successes .	357.6613179819137
 As he declaimed the sonorous measures , it was as much as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings .	142.02695580380308
 Although it is not the best of which he is capable , said Shelley as he closed the book , it is still poetry of a high order .	136.07733616356944
 If he would only leave the East , said Mary .	167.05642794701367
 I am tired of sultans and scimitars .	49.80443510785358
 The hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte , said Claire , with slightly overdone carelessness .	114.54841650084097
 How do you know that ?	181.85717954423933
 demanded Mary .	2190.552472239438
 I was told it on good authority , Claire answered darkly .	122.72407368771525
 I must n't tell , I must n't tell , she repeated to herself .	132.89941891972381
 I promised him I would n't .	169.30160579862155
 CHAPTER 9 WINTER CAME , and with it Mary 's baby- a boy as she had wished .	177.62727177888678
 William , he was called , in honor of the man who was at once Shelley 's pensioner and his most bitter detractor .	124.683139714429
 With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter Fanny and Mrs Godwin will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement , and that her child is well .	330.71725030486357
 At the same time another child- this one of Shelley 's brain- was given to the world Alastor , a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind 's musings .	119.45458581757455
 Alastor was published only to be savagely attacked , contemptuously ignored .	124.34864764568334
 Shelley sent a copy to Southey , a former friend , and another to Godwin .	165.76918296799053
 Neither acknowledged the gift .	809.64630379545
 Only Mary 's praise sustained him in his disappointment .	699.1847894539218
 She understood completely .	688.9037587131023
 Not a thought nor a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation .	322.74007526806975
 You have made the labor worth while , he said to her , smiling .	167.35726500264568
 And in the future , since I write for a public of one , I can save the poor publishers from wasting their money .	150.1321566316297
 A public of one , Mary echoed reprovingly .	73.50592343098245
 how can you say such a thing ?	463.969193920924
 There will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of Alastor .	47.58012410699305
 There are some even now .	173.6083499907071
 What about that dear , clever Mr Thynne ?	527.3769716528798
 I am sure he is in raptures .	55.81919668040451
 Poor Mr Thynne , he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement .	128.04028719169997
 There are other Mr Thynnes .	113.3084810425623
 Not everyone is bewitched by Byron 's caliphs and harem beauties .	85.55588657732648
 Mary 's supercritical attitude toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute .	254.96185905371155
 She was resentful of his easy success as compared with Shelley 's failure .	250.8888796747025
 The same month that Alastor was published , Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The Siege of Corinth , a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley 's generosity rebelled at .	306.4532110614937
 The lordly poet was at low-water mark .	78.63876829967151
 The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent .	905.241473168492
 On all sides doors were being slammed in his face .	202.66596871281425
 The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity .	142.06511824496638
 Now , under the impact of his wife 's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be .	108.52075006047708
 He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin .	453.08007946795794
 For the moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity .	91.87840855956554
 But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing .	252.82015836294303
 Byron , since the separation from his wife had been living in a smallish house in Piccadilly Terrace .	115.06781358888696
 He refused to bring Claire to it even as an occasional visitor , claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes .	167.4326018623722
 Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel .	230.82364446909543
 He had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order , but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonel 's belt .	217.18460685151504
 Despite his yearning , the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines .	152.33852254027735
 He would remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task .	259.52768338026834
 -Beckworth .	21.029389145725833
 -Sir ?	51.231999036914296
 -Fetch me the copies of everything B and C companies have requisitioned in the last six months .	276.8131917344333
 -The last six months , sir ?	583.9113883679124
 -You heard me .	86.30357302332655
 There 's a lot of waste going on here .	229.95944544128335
 It 's got to stop .	136.7271732184336
 I want to take a look .	63.73396307634012
 This is no damned holiday , Beckworth .	58.04786937501396
 Get busy .	6789.722718967076
 -Yes , sir .	73.20310556795937
 Beckworth left the tent .	103.92560746257874
 Below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank .	114.05277360174809
 He glanced back .	205.31342025412295
 The colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs , methodically tearing at his thumbnail .	115.37271875918627
 9 THE BOMBPROOF was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth .	147.55014826345575
 It stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank .	197.0882166626867
 From the outside , it seemed no more than a low drumlin , a lump on the dark earth .	87.81449052640224
 A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor .	425.1789904676618
 Two slits enabled observers to watch across the river .	376.47530302238624
 The place smelled strongly of rank , fertile earth , rotting wood and urine .	159.35611005151495
 The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson 's boots .	270.86395122416013
 At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle .	220.9400811454844
 There was no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back , stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams .	210.99129991945236
 In the corner was the soldier with the white flag .	144.21255947613716
 He stood stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth .	198.16827210782654
 Watson hardly looked at him .	543.7800709658251
 The man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant , brandishing the flag of truce .	123.65248124508452
 Someone had hauled him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed .	233.22826528658666
 An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank .	188.95282862830746
 The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy .	333.3608000442849
 When the boat had touched , the weaker ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers .	255.65408654618332
 Watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof .	80.40369805038905
 The officer had told him that both lists must be checked .	173.54410953103678
 Watson had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass .	134.34387124432342
 The officer , surprised , said he would have to see .	118.93962455375697
 Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later .	504.49489533028276
 He had peered through the darkness at the rampart .	30.377013975728836
 The men he would take back across the river stood there , but he turned away from them .	124.43281836725802
 He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt .	155.73935468223414
 He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him .	46.434824949923964
 Though Watson carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence .	271.43749106698897
 Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence could not exorcise his form .	84.23406407123528
 Watson glanced briefly at him , seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner .	824.9202895317001
 -We wo n't be too long .	142.18419380391376
 If my pass is approved , I may be a half hour .	195.6823956061218
 The soldier answered in a curious , muffled voice , his lips barely moving .	835.6947951819451
 Watson turned away and did not see the man 's knees buckle and his body sag .	139.67723722660827
 -Yes , sir .	73.25601642421077
 He had acknowledged the man .	76.49437664748339
 It was easier to think now , Watson decided .	194.4208915879879
 The stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts .	556.8504728048752
 He paced slowly , stooping , staring at the damp , slippery floor .	107.6037238621435
 He tried to order the words of the three Union officers , seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy .	162.16295396913767
 But he groped blindly .	171.853603840971
 His lack of success steadily eroded his interest .	254.14241383933808
 He stopped pacing , leaned against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift .	162.61351016046535
 A feeling of futility , an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known , seeped through him .	202.7819867918961
 What in the name of God was he doing , crouched in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river ?	167.31143356778685
 Why had he crossed the dark water , to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole ?	146.3461445210375
 He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion .	170.26755070553244
 He was conscious of a growing sense of absurdity .	160.6093031589334
 Hillman had written it all out , had n't he ?	122.95594071737875
 Was n't the report official enough ?	1107.4179180344092
 What did he hope to accomplish here ?	186.18898815326432
 Hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank .	185.69461036073378
 Prompted by a guilty urge , he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected .	133.1191547727347
 For what ?	263.847367582343
 To tell John something he would find out for himself .	229.66344471622008
 The figure in the corner belched loudly , a deep , liquid eruption .	160.0542703254223
 Watson snorted and then laughed aloud .	1026.663559833271
 Exactly !	43.349531882761404
 The soldier 's voice was muffled again , stricken with chagrin .	122.30260816325345
 He clutched the staff , and his dark eyes blinked apologetically .	124.55307018241271
 -'Scuse me , sir .	111.8375943015839
 -Let 's get out of here .	116.36869458253031
 Watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river weeds .	222.1742521456224
 To his left , the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank .	118.52933044416662
 The flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current .	184.8244690433407
 A soldier held the end of a frayed rope .	139.78225328054984
 Three Union guards appeared , carrying their rifles at ready .	1965.8737806601284
 Watson stared at them curiously .	272.5230762644302
 They were stocky men , well fed and clean-shaven , with neat uniforms and sturdy boots .	358.16330155050315
 Behind them shambled a long column of weak , tattered men .	179.17718002374988
 The thin gray figures raised a hoarse , cawing cry like the call of a bird flock .	377.38061524399575
 They moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness , elbowing and shoving .	27.10827301216713
 Four men were knocked down , but did not attempt to rise .	204.27291901832467
 They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats .	204.25532827102893
 The Union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy , indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs .	252.10787909480484
 The crawling men tried to rise and fell again .	140.9397938720936
 No one moved to them .	132.31808075796928
 Watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg shrilly .	603.1255287565095
 In a confused , soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms , the two men were dragged into the same skiff .	119.32075424422631
 The third crawling man forced himself erect .	484.380684935316
 He swayed like a drunkard , his arms milling in slow circles .	180.11236261074802
 He paced forward unsteadily , leaning too far back , his head tilted oddly .	172.77465366658296
 His steps were short and stiff , and , with his head thrown back , his progress was a supercilious strut .	142.230791440278
 He appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom .	107.35137089394392
 He stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge , his weight nearly swamping the craft .	101.01373897421746
 Watson looked for the fourth man .	211.98847406574683
 He had reached the three passive guards ; he crept in an incertain manner , patting the ground before him .	136.0352808011598
 The guards did not look at him .	105.32436342013327
 The figure on the earth halted , seemingly bewildered .	249.18289451976992
 He sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound .	160.36083240228868
 Then he began to crawl again .	40.35659017344163
 Watson watched the creeping figure .	1292.1841101909913
 He felt a spectator interest .	176.1772609389952
 Would the man make it or not ?	231.0841790403894
 If only there was a clock for him to crawl against .	146.25473880928288
 If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes , say , then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud .	98.58169770811347
 Say three minutes to make it sporting .	978.9235483781007
 Still the guards did not move , but stood inert , aloof from the slow-scrambling man .	82.1780326129596
 The figure halted , and Watson gasped .	201.3895567794785
 The man began to creep in the wrong direction , deceived by a slight rise in the ground !	285.30980119084256
 He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart .	89.19896982714101
 Watson raced for him , his boots slamming the soft earth .	484.56672794918904
 The guards came to life with astonishing menace .	520.6704248511392
 They spun and flung their rifles up .	407.9222947703539
 Watson gesticulated wildly .	955.9435985621025
 One man dropped to his knee for better aim .	494.4231832394566
 -Let me help him , for the love of God !	131.4690006003725
 The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with sullen , puzzled faces .	758.9010856279933
 Watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped , panting heavily .	94.76422654645397
 He reached down and closed his fingers on the man 's upper arm .	203.46053931192972
 Beneath his clutch , a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone .	103.71146977258054
 Watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet .	385.9328456059929
 Watson stared into a cadaverous face .	232.63667976422542
 Two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids .	353.16624849032246
 Light sticks of fingers , the tips gummy with dark earth , patted at Watson 's throat .	627.1069269845681
 The man 's voice was a sweet , patient whisper .	135.7107574967692
 -Henry said that he 'd take my arm and get me right there .	179.85013644163283
 But you ai n't Henry .	456.71526154243014
 -No .	21.816868233473866
 -It do n't matter .	165.59126357363928
 Is it far ?	373.7469847506533
 How far could it be , Watson thought bleakly , how far can a blind man crawl ?	401.17902006077554
 Another body length or all the rest of his nighted life ?	209.29585010628955
 -Not far .	70.89583418723578
 -You talk deep .	522.8913158858802
 Not like us fellas .	125.95043020151475
 It raises the voice , bein in camp .	144.77592340564175
 You Secesh ?	116.88281642993475
 -Yes .	21.279446853612335
 Come on , now .	731.2492979891963
 Can you walk ?	770.7389599940658
 -Why , course I can .	155.40554519198196
 I can walk real good .	405.5076549925334
 Watson stumbled down the bank .	650.0818506825974
 The man leaned his frail body against Watson 's shoulder .	389.5634863692009
 He was no heavier than a child .	73.66161927148683
 Watson paused for breath .	2246.965712787618
 The man wheezed weakly , his fetid breath beating softly against Watson 's neck .	367.17126908623436
 His sweet whisper came after great effort .	417.6042677636745
 -Oh , Christ h. I wish you was Henry h. He promised to take me .	473.43932583744663
 -Hush .	20.487010060857543
 We 're almost there .	197.70939790932988
 Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff .	129.69607872027302
 The man swayed on a thwart , turning his ruined eyes from side to side .	209.53520742788078
 Watson turned away , sickened for the first time in many months .	113.36635701143621
 He heard the patient voice calling .	303.9820588927861
 -Henry ?	51.73876487950607
 Where are you , Henry ?	412.07652644366016
 -Make him lie down !	290.7984748608769
 Watson snatched a deep breath .	566.6282356521455
 He had not meant to shout .	29.327540303593615
 He stood with his back to the skiff .	38.19370345902567
 The men mewed and scratched , begging to be taken away .	73.55057678349044
 Watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches .	118.26679420048742
 -Goddamn you !	89.95028648910244
 What do you do to them ?	138.24601161944426
 Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly .	26.39177275567465
 He was angry , sickened .	46.569405017338134
 He had not felt that during the afternoon .	63.0646275825816
 No , nor later .	380.681358453809
 All his emotions had been inward , self-conscious .	128.32539718244956
 In war , on a night like this , it was only the outward emotions that mattered , what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others .	151.06691260933854
 Yes .	281.4722980352007
 That was it .	26.083188525170534
 He was sure of it .	36.40056000747621
 John 's type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen .	266.2585635239009
 What a fool he had been to think of his brother !	181.02225793906146
 So Charles was dead .	424.7413931403076
 What did it matter ?	221.35096231249864
 His name had been crossed off a list .	145.5519257120194
 Already his cool body lay in the ground .	463.7153081220708
 What words had any meaning ?	504.0022337152116
 What had he thought of , to go to John , grovel and beg understanding ?	200.25090882657454
 To confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu , gouging at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade him rise and go ?	324.7051844896355
 Men were slaughtered every day , tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute .	383.2756012907796
 What made him think John had a right to witness his brother 's humiliation ?	364.68807238090244
 What right had John to any special consideration ?	608.3369534567228
 Was John better , more deserving ?	360.62110963876114
 To hell with John .	528.7465268446527
 Let him chafe with impatience to see Charles , rip open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in Hillman 's beautiful , schoolmaster 's hand .	274.9031757153235
 John would curse .	1818.0497548888736
 He believed that brave boys did n't cry .	749.9474304452566
 Watson spat on the ground .	114.39394909540397
 He was grimly satisfied .	46.64025620399636
 He had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother 's pain .	220.50643888655077
 Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering .	268.58681843018246
 I WOULD not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming , O Gogol , O Chekhov , O Thackeray and Dickens , what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris ducks , a birdbath , and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps ?	148.4805897669959
 As I say , I would n't want to begin a day like this , but I often wonder what the dead would have done .	131.10402167560753
 But the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge .	93.20845675954634
 I can see it from this window where I write .	164.51351913118327
 It was built by the Pasterns , and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property .	95.55257069783332
 It bulks under a veil of thin , new grass , like some embarrassing fact of physicalness , and I think Mrs Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning .	180.37401939033634
 It would have been like her .	52.903700728157034
 She was a pale woman .	242.94650225903243
 Sitting on her terrace , sitting in her parlor , sitting anywhere , she ground an axe of self-esteem .	236.34296996956377
 Offer her a cup of tea and she would say , Why , these cups look just like a set I gave to the Salvation Army last year .	374.2468363916516
 Show her the new swimming pool and she would say , slapping her ankle , I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes .	287.4436431133807
 Hand her a chair and she would say , Why , it 's a nice imitation of those Queen Anne chairs I inherited from Grandmother Delancy .	589.8499565661017
 These trumps were more touching than they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights were long , her children ungrateful , and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare .	160.19501601294883
 Twenty years ago , she would have been known as a golf widow , and the sum of her manner was perhaps one of bereavement .	164.79921254270096
 She usually wore weeds , and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that Mr Pastern was dead , but Mr Pastern was far from dead .	208.8050215673172
 He was marching up and down the locker room of the Grassy Brae Golf Club shouting , Bomb Cuba !	167.29074594070784
 Bomb Berlin !	343.98476299420355
 Let 's throw a little nuclear hardware at them and show them who 's boss .	656.609845563704
 He was brigadier of the club 's locker-room light infantry , and at one time or another declared war on Russia , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , and China .	225.87391633013513
 It all began on an autumn afternoon- and who , after all these centuries , can describe the fineness of an autumn day ?	247.67936812081678
 One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it .	140.45498950103024
 The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year 's lights .	223.39412240500212
 Leaves were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled , for all its ammoniac acidity , of beginnings .	133.62238419061785
 The boundless blue air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum .	156.77011784204365
 Leaving her house one late afternoon , Mrs Pastern stopped to admire the October light .	534.7178247984857
 It was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis .	48.56923881057125
 Mrs Pastern had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of receipts .	258.8825702501678
 It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks .	307.87102411598846
 Her house stood on a rise of ground , and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below .	260.17277249047976
 Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity .	341.15287413038226
 Mrs Balcolm worked for the brain .	163.42588763287523
 Mrs Ten Eyke did mental health .	988.6269045886002
 Mrs Trenchard worked for the blind .	165.03027617279267
 Mrs Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat .	278.5995659435431
 Mrs Trempler was tuberculosis , Mrs Surcliffe was Mothers ' March of Dimes , Mrs Craven was cancer , and Mrs Gilkson did the kidney .	168.28655131656015
 Mrs Hewlitt led the birthcontrol league , Mrs Ryerson was arthritis , and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton 's house , a roof that signified gout .	111.27614895379034
 Mrs Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer .	411.0768857809904
 It was her destiny ; it was her life .	98.64998354920466
 Her mother had done it before her , and even her old grandmother , who had collected money for smallpox and unwed mothers .	271.751543967797
 Mrs Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance , and most of them were ready for her .	235.21113285563104
 She experienced none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias .	237.6495700066844
 Here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry .	243.479975212942
 The contributions were ahead of what she had got the previous year , and while the money , of course , was not hers , it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks .	154.3090190197674
 She stopped at the Surcliffes ' after dusk , and had a Scotch-and-soda .	46.80044132521447
 She stayed too late , and when she left , it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband .	268.2349025310069
 I got a hundred and sixty dollars for the hepatitis fund , she said excitedly when he walked in .	164.62711558429726
 I did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans .	74.36816367054115
 I want to get my kit in tomorrow morning- would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner ?	341.4333125283463
 But I do n't know the Flannagans , Charlie Pastern said .	51.75912769657377
 Nobody does , but they gave me ten last year .	368.4044689803617
 He was tired , he had his business worries , and the sight of his wife arranging pork chops in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day .	151.82791085921627
 He was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the Blevins ' , thinking that they might give him a drink .	178.8401006282884
 But the Blevins were away ; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door .	237.64679984350045
 Turning in at the Flannagans ' driveway , he tried to remember if he had ever met them .	130.8191995177599
 The name encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the Irish .	184.34595557733894
 There was a glass pane in the front door , and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arranging flowers .	173.37129634056834
 Infectious hepatitis , he shouted heartily .	137.70356212726531
 She took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and , walking with very small steps , started toward the door .	331.09618285917566
 Oh , please come in , she said .	232.20447984193058
 The girlish voice was nearly a whisper .	41.93877472631127
 She was not a girl , he could see .	57.17025961503986
 Her hair was dyed , and her bloom was fading , and she must have been crowding forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight .	108.04600705649315
 Your wife just called , she said , separating one word from another , exactly like a child .	341.5635148334554
 And I am not sure that I have any cash- any money , that is- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook .	256.2179264318669
 Wo n't you step into the living room , where it 's cozier ?	118.84438880399244
 A fire had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been set out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts was instantaneous .	201.3249545343461
 Where was Mr Flannagan , he wondered .	122.14396160796309
 Travelling home on a late train ?	320.793599353502
 Changing his clothes upstairs ?	705.3926617262495
 Taking a shower ?	2065.0627731410164
 At the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers , and she began to riffle these , making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation .	60.430898962522825
 I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting , she said , but wo n't you make yourself a little drink while you wait ?	610.4101170216248
 Everything 's on the table .	168.16910460200654
 What train does Mr Flannagan come out on ?	860.2682888032331
 Mr Flannagan is away , she said .	82.95591935221348
 Her voice dropped .	999.6683855553549
 Mr Flannagan has been away for six weeks h .	268.5215966549411
 I 'll have a drink , then , if you 'll have one with me .	98.17150830585936
 If you will promise to make it weak .	193.82194074441875
 Sit down , he said , and enjoy your drink and look for your checkbook later .	140.10532140732374
 The only way to find things is to relax .	185.59803909114083
 All in all , they had six drinks .	165.2881521855442
 She described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly .	339.02032315296145
 Mr Flannagan manufactured plastic tongue depressors .	1212.2020852254382
 He travelled all over the world .	39.35959219313737
 She did n't like to travel .	138.16294041469342
 Planes made her feel faint , and in Tokyo , where she had gone that summer , she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home .	321.4389498249439
 She and her husband had formerly lived in New York , where she had many friends , but Mr Flannagan thought the country would be safer in case of war .	223.54536506828705
 She would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom .	1000.4819090093857
 She had no children ; she had made no friends .	106.33217718344623
 I 've seen you , though , before , she said with enormous coyness , patting his knee .	116.70878141115377
 I 've seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the convertible h .	916.2741619582914
 The thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him , although he was even more touched by her plumpness .	261.04409012012326
 Sheer plumpness , he knew , is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions .	52.75221927622815
 It serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass .	301.66192788490906
 And knowing its humble place in the scale of things , why did he , at this time of life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness ?	285.2611882688241
 The remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he did n't know what to make of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook there .	247.3711939092637
 I 've never done this before , she said later , when he was arranging himself to leave .	171.55711196418218
 Her voice shook with feeling , and he thought it lovely .	355.2189891244671
 He did n't doubt her truthfulness , although he had heard the words a hundred times .	80.33159286730591
 I 've never done this before , they always said , shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders .	495.39743939794283
 I 've never done this before , they always said , waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor .	233.36899447767095
 I 've never done this before , they always said , pouring another whiskey .	402.5396408586411
 I 've never done this before , they always said , putting on their stockings .	144.4408290719926
 On ships at sea , on railroad trains , in summer hotels with mountain views , they always said , I 've never done this before .	661.1624042413266
 Where have you been ?	375.60439655726236
 Mrs Pastern asked sadly , when he came in .	186.09741753874715
 It 's after eleven .	333.8251292576727
 I had a drink with the Flannagans .	42.97963562429191
 She told me he was in Germany .	129.20155556550213
 He came home unexpectedly .	345.5887880847625
 Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the TV room to hear the news .	467.63491590705274
 Bomb them !	82.22559259364672
 he shouted .	647.341343750128
 Throw a little nuclear hardware at them !	508.1955675899175
 Show them who 's boss !	2129.5882249093142
 But in bed he had trouble sleeping .	423.89977140272106
 He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college .	198.36264561515938
 He loved them .	81.2670099239335
 It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known .	66.68145392189136
 Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his handicap , his irons , his stance , his opponents , and his weather in detail , but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries .	324.0983024370778
 His money was tied up in a Nassau hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been running against him .	291.1919986030644
 His worries harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window .	126.34645443594361
 In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves .	128.28730250709535
 During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga .	160.74168358865353
 Maple and ash , beech and elm , one hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one hundred to win on Two in the eighth .	266.8815099105743
 Children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage .	470.85079269075777
 Then , getting back into bed , he thought unashamedly of Mrs Flannagan , planning where they would next meet and what they would do .	186.94579840737993
 There are , he thought , so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seemed , as it did , a little crude ?	209.11825959343446
 It was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years , not since their last journey eastward to witness their Uncle Izaak being lowered into the rocky soil ; that aside from due notification of certain major events in their lives two marriages , two births , one divorce , Christmas and Easter cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the widowed years .	303.91665138179116
 Her thoughts were not discrete .	495.47147576573275
 But there was a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons .	103.76682724345434
 She grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright , like a bird alert for flight .	768.1757131326386
 She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty-legged escritoire , warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray .	210.73052076197058
 There she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters , one to Abel , one to Mark .	234.79002152442433
 Once her trembling hand , with the pen grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper the words came sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips .	497.6834921131571
 And the stiffly regal look of them , she saw grimly , lacked the quaver of age which , thwarting the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string .	195.58884370044723
 Please come down as soon as you conveniently can , the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen , I have an important matter to discuss with you .	206.2787503100977
 To Abel I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here .	166.98777540613656
 I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters .	291.35869595258725
 You may stay as long as you wish , of course , but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account , I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in .	219.259790623478
 To Mark Please give my regards to Myra .	492.25612200239476
 She signed the letters quickly , stamped them , and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town .	347.17100245796905
 Then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water .	91.36641931597971
 My nephews will be coming down , she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining room , the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray .	205.65219777848515
 She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years ; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had faded to a near-absence of color which had , possibly from her constant looking at the water , something of the light of the sea in them .	137.5925226846293
 Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth .	169.63575866439157
 She smiled , and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face .	154.45843065855485
 That will be so nice for you , Mrs Packard , she said .	183.45480559540312
 Her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in Sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose .	481.4642102234044
 Um , said the old lady , and brought her eyes down to the tray .	118.9302182308145
 You remember them , I suppose ?	165.62241853890382
 She glinted suspiciously at the dish before her Blowfish .	79.3278896771056
 I hope Raphael bought them whole .	639.1952115980018
 Angelina stepped back , her eyes roaming the tray for omissions .	172.301344188398
 Then she looked at the old woman again , her eyes calm .	238.4153080985409
 Yes , she said , I remember that they came here every summer .	121.65239468037608
 I used to play with the older one sometimes , when he 'd let me .	172.31233452370887
 Abel ?	52.802271936319585
 The name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips .	274.5489650692501
 For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile .	917.4858565654123
 She would have said triumph .	254.635363335538
 Then Angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen .	471.8188111404212
 Jessica Packard lifted her head and followed the retreating figure , her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips .	395.3461004398635
 For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; then she snorted and groped for her fork .	170.69712993004262
 There 's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling away of a family .	315.6476704567294
 Procreation , expansion , proliferation- these are the laws of living things , with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments oblivion .	125.04881490446996
 When the fate of the individual is visited on the group , then the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted .	290.62911654860244
 And indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth .	404.95687286947884
 She was the last living of the older generation .	100.4558195153715
 What had once been a widespread family- at one time , she knew , there were enough Packards to populate an entire county- had now narrowed down to the two boys , Abel and Mark .	155.9820410597694
 She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans .	420.11787637681516
 What hope lay in the nephews , she asked the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sired two girl children , with none to bear on the Packard name ?	227.94795134049247
 She ate .	507.9574120246676
 It seemed to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table 's empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows .	309.877815093365
 Here , too , she talked low , quirking her head at one or another of the places , most often at Izaak 's armchair which faced her across the long table .	175.3166520719669
 Or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed , consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years .	227.72997010612508
 She thought again of her children , those two who had died young , before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies .	338.8334892980314
 The girl , her first , she barely remembered .	281.02081474334386
 It could have been anyone 's infant , for it had not survived the bassinet .	88.99343455654324
 But the boy h the boy had been alive yesterday .	182.56317290589436
 Each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her .	426.25061864386015
 He ran on his plump sticks of legs , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire .	254.33141195795486
 In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her .	292.1330685022753
 It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea .	211.1918211666764
 The brothers drove down together in Mark 's small red sports car , Mark at the wheel .	610.7686877937764
 They rarely spoke .	351.3055506429099
 Abel sat and regarded the farm country which , spreading out from both sides of the road , rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields .	184.42291005968372
 He saw the land with a stranger 's eyes , all the old familiarness gone .	115.8043284659902
 And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself .	153.08851578236548
 There was stability there , too- a color which his life had had once .	350.1330974176593
 That is what childhood is , he told himself .	116.4945275823154
 Solid , settled h lost .	1141.0847738832294
 In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt Jessica 's letter .	546.0013625020275
 What bad grace , what incredible selfishness he and Mark had shown .	641.8527175852398
 The boyhood summers preceding their uncle 's funeral might never have been .	581.2331170729515
 They had closed over , absolutely , with the sealing of old Izaak 's grave .	118.96820106089443
 The small car flew on relentlessly .	201.45134509647045
 The old woman , stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took on an ominous reality .	298.8475349643739
 Abel moved and adjusted his long legs .	403.4334706518845
 I suppose it has to do with the property , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters .	121.90970168593739
 Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness .	168.00328007722388
 He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer .	365.9703042368223
 Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother .	137.48977272555362
 Mark held the wheel loosely , but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he 'd make in the years to come .	336.9986427380775
 His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away .	150.41589731577497
 Mark easily looked years older than himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized .	618.4681766954936
 The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea .	483.27051327652873
 She did n't mention bringing Myra , Mark said , maneuvering the car into the next lane .	191.10948163666052
 She 's probably getting old- crotchety , I mean- and we figured uh-uh , better not .	182.36618454139162
 They 've never met , you know .	164.90332594222056
 But Myra would n't budge without an express invitation .	213.26481086452287
 I feel kind of bad about it .	210.87947041738738
 He gave Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel , hugging it to him , and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt .	181.40981749713137
 I imagine the old girl has n't missed us much , Mark added , his eyes on the road .	245.7665430691213
 Abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation .	383.75539941602045
 He smiled .	103.6199916069855
 It was barely possible that his brother was right .	165.01810095106035
 He could tell they were approaching the sea .	157.1109001769324
 The air took on a special strength now that they 'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind .	180.6821090311558
 There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt water , clams , seaweed and northern air .	143.5311808367099
 He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended .	220.91244839898914
 Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant .	195.7630967361367
 Remember the Starbird ?	219.38912616932754
 Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down .	211.96341280514957
 The Starbird , Abel said .	21.552606791103862
 There was the day Uncle Izaak had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy wished .	366.04238430757965
 The two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team h all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could .	528.5254019520655
 They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually .	125.2168761133429
 He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky .	337.2726340345311
 Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her sails .	109.43062568482935
 The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay .	47.94582238063177
 They came unexpectedly upon the sea .	271.07764229805844
 Meeting it without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them .	817.7673020040263
 They were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness , became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended .	419.0883253660462
 Mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water , which , there being no moon out , at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars .	290.6139083955006
 His eyes were old and they never saw well , but heated with whisky they 'd glare at my noise , growing red and raising up his rage .	426.58485207406153
 I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I could n't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling .	360.7143163480271
 Oh he 'd not care about the Pedersen kid .	187.5052989843184
 He 'd not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain .	215.7531610722539
 That would make him mad enough if he was sober .	194.94674308590416
 I did n't hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen .	136.1858033852234
 He was all shoveled up like I thought he 'd be .	85.19989484166322
 I pushed at his shoulder , calling his name .	188.68779734078205
 I think his name stopped the snoring but he did n't move except to roll a little when I shoved him .	156.3740246419892
 The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head , fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall- there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster- and I thought , Well you do n't look much like a pig-drunk bully now .	144.0359299744653
 I could n't be sure he was still asleep .	103.12703392344858
 He was a cagey sonofabitch .	8.3493817912327
 I shook him a little harder and made some noise .	301.44118262337867
 Pap-pap-pap-hey , I said .	18.608693800009043
 I was leaning too far over .	92.95770522752875
 I knew better .	129.67518218669596
 He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him .	241.07519239026465
 Oh he was smart .	287.8254425196294
 It put you off .	239.20443085961404
 I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough .	161.91127178039346
 When his arm came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck , watering my eyes , and I backed off to cough .	114.10931816763778
 Pa was on his side , looking at me , his eyes winking , the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow .	136.624169443763
 Get the hell out of here .	536.0717946109271
 I did n't say anything , trying to get my throat clear , but I watched him .	130.4555936263684
 He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear .	181.2836839238649
 It was better , though , he 'd hit me .	104.41684219323287
 He was bitter when he missed .	227.75693406162728
 Get the hell out of here .	539.6947819519663
 Big Hans sent me .	3549.8510554501545
 He told me to wake you .	166.05790720263224
 A fat hell on Big Hans .	2936.882393128707
 Get out of here .	551.0859623279036
 He found the Pedersen kid by the crib .	44.0552626137422
 Get the hell out .	1000.8853921935568
 Pa pulled at the covers .	614.8296274230182
 He was tasting his mouth .	34.6655735064433
 The kid 's froze good .	173.72951958854802
 Hans is rubbing him with snow .	666.3764465748542
 He 's got him in the kitchen .	57.4370699398001
 Pedersen ?	52.80710234548499
 No , Pa .	394.14847036078345
 It 's the Pedersen kid .	72.10571935128284
 The kid .	278.5078057048249
 Nothing to steal from the crib .	34.30462712949335
 Not stealing , Pa .	1086.9622525599007
 He was just lying there .	109.67172890422013
 Hans found him froze .	167.69812093461562
 That 's where he was when Hans found him .	217.4280719557641
 Pa laughed .	2446.834002258096
 I ai n't hid nothing in the crib .	57.5855414451156
 You do n't understand , Pa .	188.4615953935307
 The Pedersen kid .	99.97145894112167
 The kid- I god damn well understand .	1488.0020026956777
 Pa had his head up , glaring , his teeth gnawing at the place where he 'd grown a mustache once .	281.224727768841
 I god damn well understand .	3931.709018537932
 You know I do n't want to see Pedersen .	63.606763335698055
 That cock .	33.63887932773002
 Why should I ?	430.23451926574035
 What did he come for , hey ?	109.98543271073102
 God dammit , get .	215.1049059568141
 And do n't come back .	108.09514646068867
 Find out something .	144.3353570811219
 You 're a fool .	310.49213595084956
 Both you and Hans .	415.61623513304284
 Pedersen .	20.92102216858901
 That cock .	34.16536384017414
 Do n't come back .	119.72192902099442
 Out .	604.6268487495479
 Out .	598.3559201406559
 He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow .	269.79539808758216
 He had long black hairs on his wrist .	124.26327397901
 They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt .	19.07092047253174
 Big Hans made me come .	2555.8280591652315
 Big Hans said- A fat hell on Big Hans .	4491.171248470481
 He 's an even bigger fool than you are .	488.6252387666705
 Fat , hey ?	19.64691809386219
 I taught him , dammit , and I 'll teach you .	77.98762650257086
 Out .	560.6954491942505
 You want me to drop my pot ?	556.5815394413193
 He was about to get up so I got out , slamming the door .	69.68937885797601
 He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep .	124.85915372238061
 Then he threw things .	234.8466099237179
 Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister .	136.14498486890204
 Pa 'd been shit-sick in that pot .	440.7427317132292
 Hans got an axe .	263.466927127494
 He did n't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa 's door down before he stopped .	266.59888768451896
 He might not have gone that far if Pa had n't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house .	355.5035309450779
 That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it .	980.0625679795697
 I always felt the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out .	152.3254313963501
 I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs .	388.886213094954
 Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid 's chest and stomach .	786.4051566499297
 He was rubbing snow on the kid 's legs and feet .	366.48142345486775
 Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was turning pasty , sticking to the kid 's back and behind .	243.41531037522358
 Ai n't he going to wake up ?	292.9447444078497
 What about your pa ?	182.49887052569437
 He was awake when I left .	145.64490577352987
 What 'd he say ?	294.67018649652636
 Did you get the whisky ?	595.6867178345892
 He said a fat hell on Big Hans .	1028.3729288807835
 Do n't be smart .	218.555200699245
 Did you ask him about the whisky ?	418.02262260402637
 Yeah .	21.820733777635148
 Well ?	485.7918052505783
 He said a fat hell on Big Hans .	1015.317802733188
 Do n't be smart .	218.53386345636935
 What 's he going to do ?	189.5223981140227
 Go back to sleep most likely .	743.1746066466593
 You 'd best get that whisky .	797.0535029904852
 You go .	153.28269959822927
 Take the axe .	90.43975269642026
 Pa 's scared to hell of axes .	2447.7650367924443
 Listen to me , Jorge , I 've had enough to your sassing .	65.7679567702508
 This kid 's froze bad .	287.47188159856955
 If I do n't get some whisky down him he might die .	217.74762559437707
 You want the kid to die ?	515.8201456124544
 Do you ?	371.42930714455287
 Well , get your pa and get that whisky .	224.1324192804365
 Pa do n't care about the kid .	444.29155181252156
 Jorge .	21.42789598073245
 Well he do n't .	209.8352278596641
 He do n't care at all , and I do n't care to get my head busted neither .	97.6738856279031
 He do n't care , and I do n't care to have his shit flung on me .	50.865391435575475
 He do n't care about anybody .	142.14709587360167
 All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face .	556.5832771847043
 Get pig-drunk- that 's what he wants .	373.90604927127026
 He do n't care about nothing else at all .	137.15870806060957
 Nothing .	239.38122620803273
 Not Pedersen 's kid neither .	654.2958320085734
 That cock .	33.18235340675139
 Not the kid neither .	1191.9938743879543
 I 'll get the spirits , Ma said .	73.8407607860829
 I 'd wound Big Hans up tight .	5565.283826615342
 I was ready to jump but when Ma said she 'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran down .	303.54965174754074
 Ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off .	170.51542823709926
 Not any more .	360.5582693045366
 Not for years .	424.05740104693376
 The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he 'd cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she saw him heaving it again , the dirty sock popping out as it flew .	261.02398319767474
 It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa 's yellow sick insides .	288.5197057356866
 No you wo n't , Big Hans said .	948.7417813540037
 Yes , Hans , if they 're needed , Ma said .	121.85736443496431
 Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her .	586.0879159716118
 If we had , then one of us would have had to go instead .	92.77855825904557
 Hans rubbed the kid with more snow h rubbed h rubbed .	4587.937326976549
 I 'll get more snow , I said .	116.68654104112372
 I took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch .	54.38674915718948
 I do n't know where Ma went .	78.63548945777819
 I thought she 'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had .	319.6410362611991
 She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she 'd go , and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat .	359.0522866047536
 Oh , he was being queer and careful , pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm .	93.33255417714435
 He was awful angry because he 'd thought Ma was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her h I know him h I know him h we felt the same sometimes h while Ma was n't thinking about that at all , not anything like that .	261.53489409017254
 There was no way of getting even .	114.66106497821617
 It was n't like getting cheated at the fair .	79.56642096395623
 They were always trying so you got to expect it .	196.4614872190981
 Now Hans had given Ma something of his- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa- something valuable ; but since she did n't know we 'd given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back .	257.4086461402148
 Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap .	548.2848689230271
 He was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she 'd done .	156.94234538806919
 Ma had found one of Pa 's hiding places .	142.76438182801814
 She 'd found one and she had n't said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the privy and found the first one .	189.66398366621047
 Pa had a knack for hiding .	80.53810446373278
 He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it .	134.84817471616995
 But now Ma .	46.61805134597011
 She 'd found it by luck most likely but she had n't said anything and we did n't know how long ago it 'd been or how many other ones she 'd found , saying nothing .	461.9240133657636
 Pa was sure to find out .	203.11405178820107
 Sometimes he did n't seem to because he hid them so well he could n't find them himself or because he looked and did n't find anything and figured he had n't hid one after all or had drunk it up .	167.71442770586225
 But he 'd find out about this one because we were using it .	165.8349199753855
 A fool could see what was going on .	188.6772417444588
 If he found out Ma found it- that 'd be bad .	352.2702769268846
 He took pride in his hiding .	60.33652235118175
 It was all the pride he had .	83.20423674760465
 I guess fooling Hans and me took doing .	720.1480545927853
 But he did n't figure Ma for much .	82.16509351247353
 He did n't figure her at all , and if he found out h a woman h it 'd be bad .	120.85708771236844
 Hans poured some in a tumbler .	317.47724364781755
 You going to put more towels on him ?	350.64125512555177
 No .	309.78703038860067
 Why not ?	565.4697803563528
 That 's what he needs , something warm to his skin , do n't he ?	256.98858540097797
 Not where he 's froze good .	119.10551858262559
 Heat 's bad for frostbite .	263.81332219666314
 That 's why I only put towels on his chest and belly .	564.3418251849017
 He 's got to thaw slow .	471.7696538120312
 You ought to know that .	166.5777161697718
 Colors on the towels had run .	135.17907748889684
 Ma poked her toe in the kid 's clothes .	201.69538991918023
 What are we going to do with these ?	168.12687603457002
 Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid 's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin .	827.3083384535058
 Here , help me prop him up .	113.9657503440415
 I got hold his mouth open .	276.09655510919384
 I did n't want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid 's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and did n't make any move to .	237.02921309204572
 Come on , Jorge .	310.1612775534881
 All right .	272.1086660082779
 Lift , do n't shove h lift .	169.27760740844428
 OK , I 'm lifting .	109.18505238208543
 I took him by the shoulders .	77.34548418094082
 His head flopped back .	96.43308002915786
 His mouth fell open .	566.3785124926592
 The skin on his neck was tight .	285.81667532026313
 He was cold all right .	150.1831896684185
 Hold his head up .	84.29171777552139
 He 'll choke .	307.9417669529376
 His mouth is open .	187.57098248953076
 His throat 's shut .	823.6222732683989
 He 'll choke .	308.8984404547069
 He 'll choke anyway .	887.3150388304751
 Hold his head up .	86.43733413135975
 I ca n't .	124.99451023174969
 Do n't hold him like that .	145.7486155667328
 Put your arms around him .	527.2874493517406
 Well Jesus .	972.3921381913681
 He was cold all right .	149.58181642645172
 I put my arm carefully around him .	265.21048126207785
 Hans had his fingers in the kid 's mouth .	265.46646490026666
 Now he 'll choke for sure .	450.1569742720215
 Shut up .	51.671508936575066
 Just hold him like I told you .	314.5341382415199
 He was cold all right , and wet .	166.6863632193544
 I had my arm behind his back .	160.4972987391136
 He was in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing .	71.6426745952237
 There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; it was always the same unqualified success now .	238.25857905579963
 He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values .	227.0542033236714
 Stowey Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality .	212.55284471103562
 He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rose at half-past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop .	395.3078759193965
 This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist .	534.8543029626246
 The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor .	335.7031007837954
 His files , desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos .	617.7563040458132
 Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form his models , drawings , ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac .	189.45411610327002
 Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house .	181.31213763037997
 He worked standing , with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person 's hand .	296.7798070304901
 Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved .	163.10850965802766
 It all seemed- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows- as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler 's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss 's work .	143.47860725644153
 This air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine .	267.4724901927169
 But he was not bored at all ; he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it .	173.68179101568447
 There are , after all , fortunate souls who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey was , as things go , a fortunate man .	234.98156717460276
 He left his home the day after New Year 's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat .	199.49377767814877
 He would wear this same costume in Florida , despite his wife Cleota 's reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him .	276.9414209194486
 But he was too busy to hear what she was saying .	112.8032643142093
 So they parted when she was in an impatient humor .	252.50418755147948
 When he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon , feeling in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before , she came out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head , which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window .	156.94054331793976
 Finding the key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog , and said , Defrost the refrigerator .	187.67382190377796
 He saw the surprise in her face , and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen .	103.03042512951056
 He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him .	623.3799150812987
 He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it .	527.4387780479714
 He would settle himself into his seat to laugh .	303.0220534428237
 Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing .	195.69903481071577
 And she was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog , mad as she was at his going away when he really did n't have to , mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by .	284.54260893643334
 She was forty-nine at this time , a lanky woman of breeding with an austere , narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer .	176.47596583418937
 Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders .	581.1688940868129
 There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from money-making and which , besides , has kept its estate intact .	285.20311698527746
 She was personally sloppy , and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist , and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves .	160.5251723310559
 But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed , brushed , and taking breaths of air , and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy , a grace of history , so to speak , and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value .	237.9197498943035
 She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp .	444.87803668092374
 Now drive carefully , for God 's sake !	580.5788061273449
 she called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure .	604.697399053813
 But he did not notice , and was already backing the car down to the road , saying Toot-toot !	153.06321382909832
 to the stump of a tree as he passed it , the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed .	127.77996680856936
 She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road .	221.68467467672454
 Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window .	94.66823093710491
 She had begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell .	276.42161708712126
 He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once .	229.0274108490774
 Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said Toot !	539.4246701221783
 once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .	230.77478897081735
 She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building .	403.8742801230694
 There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind .	85.22550551041957
 She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the realest part of life .	252.28914544096503
 Now she could let out the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors ; she could dust the plants , then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on ; improvise cha-chas on the harp ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers , reading the ads as well as the news , registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire .	239.17217133040657
 She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting to be .	278.6673089512064
 She fell asleep leaning on her hand , hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm .	195.48158647391583
 Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers .	184.37363068485837
 Then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes .	238.5244516546517
 She stood up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests .	161.71358075135709
 She went into the living room and turned on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway .	213.5213281851608
 She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself .	457.5820190415347
 They were both so young , after all , so unready for any final parting .	109.45683208614099
 How could it have been thirty years already , she wondered ?	393.5289480395405
 But yes , nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine , and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen .	179.71060816652493
 She stood still over the leg of lamb , rubbing herbs into it , quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath , a sensation of violence that started her shivering .	273.03060588378327
 But they all said , No , your time will come .	184.67320266926222
 Enjoy being a bride while you can .	346.6506375889955
 There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning House where the Albright boys always took their brides , till they could get a house and a farm of their own .	154.0006736622709
 So when the Big House filled up and ran over , the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes .	330.742992589658
 And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do .	140.50593042382607
 So Linda Kay gave up asking , and accepted her reprieve .	307.30032821944485
 Without saying so , she was really grateful ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joe 's wife .	432.1017561178543
 She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it spotless and neat , shabby as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe .	166.6339685155381
 She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this .	159.5138164185911
