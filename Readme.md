To execulte the language model, enter  
```
python3 main.py  
```
You can then enter the sentence you wanna test, and get the perplexities. If you want to get perplexities of training and validation instead, then turn the value `write_perplexities` in line 3 of the code to true.  
**NOTE**: text_splitter.py contains code for splitting the corpus into training/testing/validation.
