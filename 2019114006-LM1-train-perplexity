 The jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might <unk> this program in our less populous counties .	882.7764281389008

 Daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help <unk> an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug 31 .	1603.138339672664
 He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the <unk> law which has been on the books since Texas was a republic .	473.061073427391
 It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more .	807.2495118683056

 His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , <unk> B Jones of Houston , J B <unk> of <unk> and Howard Cox of Austin .	758.5501216245154

 When the shouting ended , the bill passed , <unk> to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen George Parkhouse of Dallas .	468.2988625845274
 Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen Parkhouse .	1261.8193926029853
 The bill would increase from <unk> to <unk> the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project .	251.0474514234499
 Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas .	2764.046160908508
 <unk> by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten 's attack .	997.276224003588
 The bill 's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J W <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> de la <unk> of Mission , Sam F Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of <unk> Springs .	922.6284721273178

 We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence , Martin said .	824.2800413622825
 The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems <unk> limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color .	702.1178856359658
 These , he said , are two of the principal underlying causes for family <unk> leading to ADC .	346.22359245101904

 Several defendants in the <unk> police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday .	1563.1968737626428
 The <unk> by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , <unk> observers and was viewed as the <unk> to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial .	679.1169935137077
 Bellows made the <unk> when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan <unk> , 30 , a separate trial .	521.877361591683
 Bellows made the request while the <unk> jury was out of the <unk> .	158.30007153769984
 <unk> <unk> <unk> The statements may be highly <unk> to my client , Bellows told the court .	245.5643477963558
 Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property .	1073.7924372286127
 It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others .	453.96644115239604
 Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this ?	2190.105223325757
 Yes , your honor , replied Bellows .	1135.1451486795124
 What this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a <unk> fight in this case .	161.52180066176032
 There is a conflict among the defendants .	208.88688369041998
 WASHINGTON , <unk> 24 - President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio .	1542.7039890676008
 The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first <unk> of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone .	584.8838567910773
 Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in <unk> from <unk> Port , Mass , a White House spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion .	726.7320068427252
 <unk> ARE <unk> Asked to elaborate , Pierre Salinger , White House press secretary , replied , I would say it 's got to go thru several more <unk> .	880.345483901329
 Salinger said the work President Kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia 's demands and proposals for the city .	968.8004534952883
 The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M Karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means .	1574.9350775204855
 Karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the 50 persons .	466.9440756971145
 He said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens .	309.23860573162824
 Karns ' ruling <unk> to eight of the 10 cases .	538.3779199123695
 In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case .	156.03258759454252
 <unk> proceedings originally had been brought against <unk> persons in 133 precincts by Morris J Wexler , special <unk> .	1265.180588437226
 ISSUE <unk> <unk> Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury <unk> to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury .	844.8639224565543
 Mayer Goldberg , attorney for election judges in the <unk> precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation .	1657.4024967601877
 Wexler has denied repeatedly that <unk> was used in questioning .	634.4599142095544
 Karns said it was a <unk> act for Wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room .	647.6781936364022
 He said this constituted a very serious misuse of the Criminal court processes .	720.1550247221392
 Actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county , <unk> <unk> of the authority of that court is not the function of this court , said Karns , who is a City judge in East St Louis sitting in Cook County court .	408.3255150563354
 <unk> <unk> <unk> Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons .	993.8984846809259
 Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary <unk> of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another .	455.839326448948
 The cases involved judges in the <unk> , 24th , and <unk> precincts of the <unk> ward , the <unk> and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward .	369.99827110030657
 The case of the judges in the <unk> precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under <unk> by Karns .	282.513179637191
 Two other cases also were under <unk> .	337.00051150930926
 <unk> <unk> <unk> After reading his statement <unk> the 23d ward case , Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been <unk> , he would dismiss them .	703.4115146331598
 WASHINGTON , FEB 9 - President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of <unk> million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs .	2426.154102628614
 The President , in a special message to Congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research .	1486.6548534181181
 The aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol hill .	964.1464164963492
 It was defeated in Congress last year .	462.3286916684639
 COST UP TO 37 A YEAR It would be financed by <unk> the social security payroll tax by as much as 37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes .	1699.0485236319564
 The social security payroll tax is now 6 per <unk> 3 per cent on each worker and <unk> on the first <unk> of pay per year .	369.4816513257423
 The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to 5,000 a year and the payroll tax to <unk> per <unk> <unk> per cent each .	485.3149556694322
 Similar payroll tax <unk> would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system .	727.2852087840246
 The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs .	775.6233869393269
 <unk> WOULD <unk> Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 .	1001.9391133985298
 Both figures would go higher in later years .	709.3851305012375
 Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would <unk> federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years .	1010.9498169217953
 These would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes .	359.7302363239429
 <unk> HOME <unk> The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 1 .	1789.1458268048889
 Full payment of hospital bills for <unk> up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay 10 a day of the cost for the first nine days .	410.25476427589615
 2 .	219.29270417628427
 Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital .	2259.109458927163
 A patient could receive up to 300 days <unk> nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the <unk> credit .	805.2164498742028
 3 .	252.3923281920604
 Hospital <unk> <unk> diagnostic service for all costs in excess of 20 a patient .	580.3484369025279
 4 .	238.22596561633384
 Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness .	3044.988242018413
 The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged .	1690.714267913165
 <unk> <unk> <unk> He said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers ' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their <unk> or those of their <unk> caused by an extended hospital stay .	405.9085203735172
 This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs , he said , and with sufficient <unk> ' requirements to discourage any <unk> or unnecessary <unk> of our hospitals .	447.6336904706568
 This is not a program of <unk> medicine .	82.14731612883274
 It is a program of <unk> of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed .	348.5575962333451
 Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital .	725.2924620435741
 WOULD N'T <unk> <unk> The plan does not cover doctor bills .	1711.3111916512744
 They would still be paid by the patient .	133.4571681606566
 Apart from the aged care plan the President 's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools .	1384.4973567202621
 The President said the nation 's <unk> medical and 47 dental schools can not now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care .	849.2663779505309
 Moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and <unk> because they ca n't afford the schooling costs .	506.09831823533534
 <unk> TO <unk> The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to 1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students .	734.7472250444947
 The schools could use the money to pay <unk> scholarships , based on need , of up to 2,000 a year per student .	446.9760924736984
 In addition , the government would pay a 1,000 cost of education grant to the schools for each 1,500 in scholarship grants .	471.99141006353966
 Officials estimated the combined programs would cost <unk> million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 .	966.0962972765012
 The President recommended federal matching grants totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or <unk> the capacity of existing ones .	1930.5220969018646
 MORE FOR <unk> <unk> In the area of community health services , the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction .	1236.347139787359
 He asked for another 10 million dollar initial appropriation for <unk> grants to states to improve nursing homes .	1635.9971429848754
 He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals .	1480.5060678789507
 In the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children 's bureau .	537.6198281724218
 He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute .	1217.9597707762614
 <unk> RESEARCH FUNDS The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation .	1577.0146614473606
 He did not say by how much .	144.33344863617933
 For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities .	1141.1305423336553
 The President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the <unk> million dollars in the <unk> budget for direct government research in medicine .	466.53426328156615
 The President said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them .	469.6642873473292
 REACTION AS EXPECTED Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines .	2834.071845442832
 <unk> who last year opposed placing <unk> under the social security system criticized the President 's plan .	825.8407370348557
 Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message .	2209.9270249033457
 Senate Republican Leader <unk> Ill and House Republican Leader Charles <unk> <unk> said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance .	1955.2554660514488
 <unk> said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first .	1155.6736294397524
 House Speaker Sam Rayburn D , Tex called the Kennedy program a mighty fine thing , but made no prediction on its fate in the House .	1127.8507585479763
 WASHINGTON , FEB 9 - Acting hastily under White House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C Weaver as the nation 's federal housing chief .	4553.907123728159
 Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote .	602.9222314788731
 A number of scattered <unk> and <unk> was heard .	70.75322703548419
 <unk> Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency .	834.6764353287738
 In the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor .	915.2665399953709
 <unk> BY DEMAND The rule was enforced by demand of Sen Wayne Morse D , <unk> in connection with President Eisenhower 's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy 's in 1961 .	1680.1849724412398
 <unk> The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign <unk> has been the freer , <unk> , and wider discussions , <unk> by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings .	800.3465157335797
 This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes .	596.7415219514535
 In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of <unk> , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems .	309.5988339991236
 This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the <unk> powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems .	358.695504338863
 The <unk> of a <unk> between those in trouble in Africa , <unk> by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally <unk> of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been <unk> by its absence .	247.1871684704448
 <unk> <unk> In the case of <unk> , which a few weeks ago was <unk> ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its <unk> policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension .	330.99629228589197
 The general , remarkably <unk> , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council .	417.27899250313874
 There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad <unk> NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as <unk> will be discussed in advance .	604.1607712171976
 Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO <unk> .	488.08825868733965
 Even <unk> , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this <unk> capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line .	387.8797944246963
 On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for .	471.60050361260033
 One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk 's speeches as <unk> .	1063.3809573731921
 But he hastened to add that , if United States policies were not always clear , despite Mr Rusk 's analysis of the various global danger points and <unk> for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy .	557.6481504212707
 <unk> <unk> A certain <unk> may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a <unk> affair , with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents <unk> .	445.7471536357551
 The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr Rusk 's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and <unk> frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to <unk> firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .	728.2975672273367
 The Secretary of State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months .	315.3108884683572
 But where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only <unk> the United States ' profound attachment to the alliance , <unk> of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO 's disposal in European waters .	452.0047057574187
 The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another <unk> in Berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole .	374.6293341478821
 <unk> <unk> The secretary 's greatest achievement is perhaps the <unk> of NATO realization that East-West friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection .	750.0447154024521
 The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic <unk> and Development when <unk> as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent .	475.46999614276456
 This increase in the threshold , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance 's most difficult problems in the months to come .	314.0486638683947
 Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled .	1014.2143722389395
 WASHINGTON The Kennedy administration moves <unk> toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy <unk> for the first time .	964.2296827438021
 There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos .	440.7165463948167
 The United States , State Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam .	1605.6831543811238
 They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this .	559.8400709746791
 The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated .	1259.8892555185314
 But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility .	330.649872877246
 POLICIES <unk> The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos , rather than continue to insist on a <unk> of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference .	720.6392049291466
 This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make .	417.07959428553863
 It <unk> these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration .	423.3196324969634
 Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas .	696.6135373386142
 But with the months moving on- and the immediate <unk> with the Communists showing no gain for the free world- the question arises How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ?	1409.0841354493011
 <unk> <unk> Richard M Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union .	881.1303040746253
 He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy 's tendency to be too <unk> .	302.486611104549
 GOP <unk> It does not take a <unk> poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this <unk> the situation as Republicans see it .	549.0906476454701
 They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made <unk> and monumental <unk> in Cuba .	322.9509766044019
 One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he did n't attack the Kennedy administration on this score .	1031.4144194443716
 His reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now .	120.47704776482128
 But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first .	504.53367209305
 The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator <unk> B Morton R of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican National Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination .	1230.2969416364733
 Kennedy administration policies also have been <unk> now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston University , <unk> , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators .	986.8465615183208
 <unk> <unk> This group <unk> with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by <unk> groups .	214.94926770156633
 It <unk> that the United States seek instead to <unk> the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic <unk> and a resumption of trade relations ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds .	689.5644484198509
 Mr Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation .	757.8073196164414
 But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated .	888.9469233488614
 Until the Cuban <unk> and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had <unk> a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr Nixon and the professors .	579.7974172149228
 AID <unk> <unk> Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the <unk> period of the administration .	700.3630207645627
 <unk> efforts were made to remove pin <unk> from administration statements .	534.2076873224897
 <unk> on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed .	1749.9295960885615
 But thus far there has been no response in kind .	349.42598069673255
 Foreign aid programs were <unk> to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations .	1237.2633995012673
 In Laos , the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture .	1380.975136462237
 Again and again it asked the Communists to freeze the military situation in Laos .	534.641271817073
 But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate .	1040.2984866076688
 And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization .	2305.762363316355
 SEATO was steamed up and prepared <unk> plans for coping with the military losses in Laos .	642.0222597815476
 But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos .	673.4306609271893
 Some SEATO nations <unk> , however .	381.1088232922133
 There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet Nam .	929.9775348285285
 The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos .	642.8351215751411
 The pro-Western government , which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma neutralist government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army .	845.3212265908081
 There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the <unk> .	279.40011935274015
 If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma , whom it felt was too <unk> of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish them .	604.2736836746168
 One factor was the statement of Senator J W <unk> D of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .	799.3484556196819
 He declared on March 25 that the United States had <unk> a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of Prince Souvanna .	432.4122755954779
 WASHINGTON The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile <unk> in the United States .	607.879623923426
 The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation .	238.1750162901962
 In an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President 's committee on <unk> <unk> and <unk> , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems .	522.6016968389534
 The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in <unk> this disturbing crime trend .	724.6978976106298
 <unk> <unk> The President has also called upon the Attorney General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem .	281.57509892130497
 Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L <unk> , a special assistant <unk> the Attorney General , as executive director of the new Committee on <unk> <unk> and Youth <unk> .	443.46324175564075
 His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases <unk> juvenile <unk> have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in <unk> .	561.9055530150918
 Among <unk> reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and <unk> involved persons under 18 years of age .	610.3638991696998
 East Providence should organize its civil defense <unk> and begin by <unk> a full-time director , Raymond H Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes .	1361.8698816042968
 Mr Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time .	867.9193990019663
 East Providence now has no civil defense program .	1415.9343202687023
 Mr Hawksley , the state 's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years .	370.736638754514
 He is not interested in being named a full-time director .	314.689522359237
 Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation 's civil defense program , Mr Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director .	1014.2274864681142
 He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about 3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to <unk> the salary costs .	576.0468666528883
 Mr Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job .	813.9963280051159
 One of these men is former Fire Chief John A <unk> , he said .	463.22656205536555
 Along with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized .	601.3755878324841
 Mr Hawksley said .	658.0346816114443
 One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program .	555.6790614308259
 <unk> funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , <unk> and rescue trucks , he said .	397.8445503727305
 Mr Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station .	2178.4396964680386
 He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the <unk> section of the city and the other to the <unk> area .	95.95014275865336
 Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack .	308.80507331838226
 The Narragansett <unk> <unk> grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a <unk> theater in <unk> would be another .	146.90544129148418
 <unk> residents would go to the <unk> assembly point .	185.2793024319098
 Mr Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack .	687.0410618166335
 Such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know .	338.64568041466083
 If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally .	898.8804560178029
 One of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid .	187.10559344948345
 Other steps would be developed after information <unk> down to the local level from the federal government .	236.39643745423933
 Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind .	1194.4724122794607
 Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly .	481.32406772161727
 The governor 's move into the so-called blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R Grant , deputy city clerk of Central Falls .	1062.1412634564301
 A copy was released to the press .	194.8534809856211
 Mr Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant .	952.3672977747788
 The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature .	352.02298249382557
 While the city council suggested that the <unk> Council might perform the review , Mr Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty Gen J Joseph Nugent to get the benefit of his views .	671.351733655678
 He will then appoint the study committee with Mr Nugent 's cooperation , the governor said .	520.3422201521045
 I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings , Mr Notte said , to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and <unk> groups affected by these laws .	434.3263452207748
 The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales .	795.5059568472927
 The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws .	907.2157327861441
 Should there be evidence they are <unk> , he has said , the state police will step into the situation .	231.4284333779933
 There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws .	693.2588225280556
 The statutes , similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the <unk> .	516.8027924412875
 The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday .	1639.727833950054
 The only day they have a chance to compete with large <unk> is on Sunday , the council 's resolution said .	289.855911171511
 The small shops must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community , according to the resolution , which added that they also are the source of <unk> for thousands of our neighbors .	230.30329485662455
 It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government .	1283.8326141240987
 The council advised the governor that large <unk> , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business on Sunday .	758.9392288749752
 They operate on a volume basis , it was contended , and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community .	320.9664958660719
 Liberals and <unk> in both <unk> Democratic and <unk> should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George H Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday .	1195.1932771225368
 Mr Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the <unk> Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system .	507.4075933749751
 He suggested that a <unk> of forces might allow the average <unk> a better pull at the right lever for him on election day .	302.3107893994132
 He said he was <unk> that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 .	120.71425449419247
 That , he added , was when he was a very young man , a machinist and <unk> by trade .	113.04444028147546
 That was before I studied law .	275.0940015139597
 Some of my fellow workers were <unk> me for an office in the Socialist Party .	372.4624333140189
 The lawyer with whom I studied law <unk> me off the Socialist track .	594.8879825376326
 He <unk> me to the right <unk> the free enterprise track .	155.89697731234705
 He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the <unk> of all resources .	207.71937870047094
 He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties .	800.1518859566334
 Mr Reama , who retired as vice president of the American <unk> Co in 1955 said , Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national <unk> but neither told us how to achieve it .	649.7259961999175
 He said he favors wage increases for <unk> but manufacturers are caught in a profit <unk> and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added .	465.8316943109525
 <unk> the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr Reama said A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own .	673.2362867838751
 Mr Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling .	1144.356297610445
 A petition bearing the signatures of more than <unk> Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town .	847.4901294475977
 William A Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond <unk> <unk> .	644.0389507467113
 The law which <unk> home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of <unk> for <unk> of the signatures within 10 days and Mr Martinelli happens to hold that post .	454.1468345465056
 Mr Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the <unk> of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days .	883.1879852568005
 He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of <unk> completes its work .	465.59644674482837
 A difference of opinion arose between Mr Martinelli and John P <unk> , town <unk> , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled .	422.3050609665494
 Mr Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while Mr <unk> said that a special election might be called instead .	320.18646998727286
 Mr <unk> said that he had consulted several Superior Court <unk> in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures .	689.8045530972923
 He assured Mr Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible .	424.40428073262876
 Mr Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement .	1645.0468579341891
 He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes .	353.1334058862382
 After inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow through on it , he declared .	524.5661702672159
 It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will <unk> the movement .	363.8477921640528
 He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required <unk> ballot for posts on the charter commission .	317.78591928788063
 Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement , he indicated , and to tell them what this will mean for the town .	300.5093419670472
 He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September .	465.81493837543513
 Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town 's <unk> Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter .	1075.7891091635024
 <unk> opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated .	243.02978415328693
 <unk> of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed false <unk> .	763.3116103116438
 Several <unk> affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston <unk> District sewer system .	458.11667149977427
 Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay <unk> at the local police station may be taken at Monday 's special North Providence Town Council meeting .	2545.479461264404
 Council president Frank <unk> said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town <unk> Michael A <unk> to draft the ordinance .	1854.9641415242377
 At the last session of the General Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective .	470.3408560363788
 Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation .	486.467431433966
 At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition .	1667.4794936872502
 Local police have hesitated to <unk> them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense .	728.3722648088901
 <unk> - James P Mitchell and Sen Walter H Jones <unk> , last night <unk> on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is <unk> on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism .	929.4192556467552
 Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen Wayne <unk> Jr <unk> did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel .	1402.5835387758586
 The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club .	3013.1706673778576
 It was greeted with a chorus of <unk> by 500 women in <unk> Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women 's Clubs .	369.8676066098505
 Hughes said Monday , It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the <unk> <unk> after Eisenhower retired .	625.2682960477642
 Now he 's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the <unk> remains to the people of the state .	132.51958874258005
 Sunday he had added , We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president h but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership .	509.52311730949185
 Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign .	383.1797897559435
 How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this ?	639.95592825111
 he asked .	228.33219519625516
 The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his <unk> .	470.27977343253724
 Mitchell said the <unk> of the outcome in last fall 's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue .	571.6323164171998
 <unk> <unk> Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president .	494.1201126484296
 He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign , he said , because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into <unk> an old national campaign .	378.8378071871814
 The audience last night did not respond with either applause or <unk> to mention of Hughes ' remark .	682.584481775515
 <unk> spoke on the merit of having an open primary .	376.2407550324874
 He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign .	204.8828931868203
 State aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industry .	689.2576183268237
 <unk> <unk> Mitchell <unk> the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the <unk> State Senate Must share the blame for this .	419.96453396296346
 Nothing that <unk> last year had lost the <unk> <unk> Co plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform .	398.1077619163858
 But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time , Mitchell said .	304.15541195091913
 Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his <unk> for Mitchell .	466.1360995822928
 He said Mitchell is against the <unk> of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises .	624.0212058622411
 He calls for help while saying he is against <unk> , but you ca n't have it both ways , Jones said .	365.3365439751857
 The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue .	479.85522424122195
 <unk> <unk> <unk> , Mitchell said in a statement I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J Hughes .	806.4656799537545
 His reference to <unk> carcass ' or <unk> remains ' of the president 's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the <unk> intentions of the free nations .	263.5309633539175
 I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste .	1057.8153587679706
 Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature .	451.17015643880006
 It can only <unk> to Mr Hughes ' <unk> .	158.61348085546192
 <unk> <unk> <unk> Sen Charles W Sandman , <unk> May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination .	992.5363251961827
 Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones .	1548.4407877040521
 Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party 's <unk> with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years .	601.4776626406434
 Sandman said The announcement that Sen Clifford Case <unk> , has decided to spend all his available time <unk> for Mr Mitchell is a dead <unk> .	864.5204457133517
 It is a desperate effort to <unk> up a <unk> candidate who has proven he can not answer any questions about New Jersey 's problems .	434.7441789469947
 We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington .	528.7610683965036
 That failed .	206.29386318248424
 We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr Mitchell some of the glow of Sen Case 's candidacy of last year .	874.6371045844188
 That , too , will fail .	155.32425310739984
 Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs Harriet <unk> <unk> of 330 <unk> Ave , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee .	917.6588926825874

 County <unk> <unk> R Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper <unk> in those counties in the state which still use them .	438.75622531756807
 The proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a lip service word .	853.2556497528903
 Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge .	1032.9218029261945
 Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January , <unk> .	469.2841095187336
 Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically <unk> , he added that the vital interest in election results <unk> county lines .	855.2469051987543
 The candidacy of Mayor James J <unk> of West Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County , was supported today by Edward W <unk> , West Orange public safety commissioner .	1399.5348786738566
 <unk> , a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization 's candidate , <unk> William <unk> , for the vacancy left by the resignation of <unk> <unk> , now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals .	297.0639389500635
 My experience as public safety commissioner , <unk> said , has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer .	582.663538314217
 Jim <unk> fits that description .	1260.0155518076297
 <unk> - William J <unk> , state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development , has retired after 36 years of service .	873.1297128136673

 <unk> - Richard J Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a <unk> to carry the issues to every corner of the state .	726.7353142304452
 He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the <unk> Inn When I come back here after the November election you 'll think , 'You 're my man- you 're the kind of governor we 're glad we elected ' .	1560.8514955302328
 He said , We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time .	247.6781825378954
 <unk> <unk> In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said , The three Republican candidates for governor are <unk> over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary .	485.7964257049349
 But we 'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform .	494.8314516115966
 We 'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson .	314.4867273074127
 We 'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November .	238.99811825937215
 He said , You can see signs of the Republicans ' feeble attack on the Meyner administration .	508.30075795307096
 But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead .	266.8019586097747
 He urged New Jersey to become a full partner in the <unk> actions of President Kennedy .	431.842201086792
 He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the <unk> of industry by Southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry .	269.3100889692607

 <unk> <unk> The plan will provide 45 million for purchase of open land by the state .	418.8303293516704
 The other 15 million is to be <unk> to municipalities on a matching fund basis .	312.92668597322717
 Hughes said , This is not a plan to <unk> <unk> but to <unk> it , pointing out the state population has increased <unk> each year since 1950 .	273.7472053535558
 He said Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve .	698.7138225103207
 Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved .	856.1593877348445
 He said no matter what stand he takes it would be <unk> that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans .	159.49452683518973
 After the primary , he promised , I 'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration .	426.55914930812116
 I 'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican <unk> .	194.58311607872713
 <unk> - Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are <unk> <unk> this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues .	805.4155900425931
 The outgoing members , whose <unk> terms will <unk> a week after the April 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory <unk> , to remember the state committee by .	811.8960714544735
 There may be other 1961 state committee <unk> come April 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters .	540.128795355167
 A special presentation was made to Mrs <unk> Thompson of Red Bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee .	521.3981126161545
 She also was the original GOP national <unk> from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women 's suffrage amendment .	803.5159907903536
 She served one <unk> term on the national committee .	327.2072277049297
 <unk> <unk> up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R <unk> and Abraham D <unk> as running mates .	1276.947813790419
 At the same time reaction among <unk> Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor 's reported plan was generally favorable .	500.5556455999788
 Some <unk> Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years .	512.1546251368738
 The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor 's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders .	1224.574158470777
 Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party .	1077.5375694816316
 <unk> <unk> Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr Wagner for the <unk> nomination in the Sept 7 Democratic primary .	2310.9672418034133
 These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city .	422.8128872010377
 Their view is that <unk> changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor .	538.8785368332108
 In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , Mr Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A Buckley , the Bronx Democratic leader , and with Joseph T <unk> , the Brooklyn Democratic leader .	1280.5885131180512
 <unk> <unk> <unk> As usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with <unk> G De <unk> , the Manhattan leader .	278.38170660675
 He is publicly on record as believing Mr De <unk> should be replaced for the good of the party .	342.024498582582
 Last night the Mayor visited Mr Buckley at the Bronx leader 's home for a discussion of the situation .	669.5618757788953
 Apparently he believes Mr Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization 's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle .	1092.372378945526
 In talks with Mr Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader 's <unk> to dropping Controller Lawrence E Gerosa , who lives in the Bronx , from this year 's ticket .	1006.2073891079067
 But Mr Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr Gerosa 's successor .	623.1651993586997
 <unk> AND <unk> <unk> The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr <unk> , who lives in Queens , to replace <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr <unk> , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr Gerosa as the candidate for Controller .	367.28654665956725
 The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties <unk> on the Hunter College <unk> in the Bronx .	463.1565467570605
 After his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday 's New York Times .	399.20559813669047
 The Mayor said It did n't come from me .	474.7628171547193
 But as I have said before , if I announce my candidacy , I will have something definite to say about running mates .	466.09470685303796

 A political scientist writes of the growth of alienated voters , who believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control .	1451.983605996684
 h These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to <unk> them .	348.79702477888054
 <unk> is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the <unk> of Edwin O'Connor 's novel , The Last <unk> .	269.2716755725981
 But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject .	196.23375545748914
 A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year .	832.6935690407538
 <unk> in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations .	347.27415112371716

 WASHINGTON , JUNE 18 - Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers .	4238.618016630117
 In the Senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition .	494.10236406493823
 In the House , the <unk> coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration 's housing bill , while more <unk> is expected in an attempt to advance the <unk> bill .	249.24912710755217
 The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee .	553.3183988014086
 It is expected to be reported out Tuesday , but this is a little uncertain .	194.95946035102543
 The panel 's action depends on the return of Representative James W <unk> , Democrat of Arkansas , who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn 's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor .	676.573218808374
 Mr <unk> has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday .	331.2583428443379
 <unk> IS <unk> The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans .	925.4297785243518
 The Democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week .	518.4417752392263
 The <unk> measure , which was passed last Monday by the Senate , provides for <unk> mortgages at low <unk> for <unk> families .	285.4783189256032
 It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories .	1962.4372515721866
 The education bill appears to be temporarily <unk> in the Rules Committee , where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are <unk> because of the religious controversy .	472.5132551495088
 They are James J <unk> of Queens and Thomas P <unk> Jr of Massachusetts .	610.0904179174188
 THREE <unk> TO <unk> What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill <unk> the National Defense Education Act of 1958 .	825.1465392932032
 This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other <unk> facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics .	876.8539235897704
 Mr <unk> and Mr <unk> are not willing to vote on the <unk> measure until the defense education bill <unk> the House Education and Labor Committee .	409.05488930088393
 About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps .	757.0050047148598
 In the <unk> budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval , <unk> would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies .	448.6837471155159
 <unk> projects proposed by private groups are at the <unk> stage , Gordon <unk> , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a Washington interview .	325.6433514672905
 Six of these were proposed by religious groups .	658.8350930707998
 They will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin America .	628.151439376968
 QUESTION <unk> <unk> with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals .	653.7516685741427
 There are a number of ways this could happen , the <unk> pointed out , and here is an example Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled .	449.6012525543323
 When he protested , the hotel owner said Why do you worry ?	1153.5684804684292
 The U S Government is paying for it .	501.5795531182399
 The U S Government pays for all its overseas workers .	1003.4378986003143
 <unk> <unk> I do n't work for the Government , the American said .	102.01094999321647
 I 'm a missionary .	418.0363080485077
 The hotel owner <unk> .	269.99044508593454
 <unk> thing , he said .	44.88138938651591
 And then , some <unk> remarked , there is a more classical <unk> problem Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ?	968.049079087721
 R Sargent Shriver Jr , director of the corps , is certain that they can .	855.3419207918433
 No religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive Peace Corps funds unless it <unk> all <unk> on the project it proposes .	605.0072990737998
 <unk> , JUNE 18 - At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia , Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming Look , he took everything I had !	1205.057550749167
 Mr Khrushchev was <unk> in the <unk> mood of the successful <unk> .	81.81865714001772
 Indonesia is one of the twenty <unk> countries of Asia , Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid .	754.3769187848568
 The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the <unk> nations .	458.7028259032788
 The Communist countries <unk> more than <unk> in economic aid alone last year , according to Western estimates .	590.9415444387286
 This was the biggest annual <unk> since the Communist program for the <unk> countries made its modest beginning in 1954 .	310.45903185983343
 In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries .	1454.9370083935692
 UNITED <unk> , N Y , JUNE 18 - A committee of experts has recommended that a country 's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations .	655.5763825842571
 This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations .	549.086537689874
 One effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India .	388.42738553084473
 India is the most populous United Nations member with more than <unk> inhabitants .	1219.8835191625112
 The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report .	331.8557573656233

 The decision was made in <unk> by Prince Boun <unk> , Premier of the pro-Western royal Government ; Prince Souvanna Phouma , leader of the nation 's <unk> and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc , and Prince <unk> , head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces .	628.4001292734378
 The latter two are <unk> .	92.40558513122046
 Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western <unk> who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth <unk> session of the <unk> conference on the future of Laos .	345.0254120161996
 An agreement among the <unk> on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats conceded .	709.234128353888
 But no one was overly optimistic .	484.8641825705058
 <unk> <unk> IN <unk> W <unk> <unk> of the United States , <unk> <unk> of Britain , Maurice <unk> de <unk> , France 's Foreign Minister , and Howard C Green , Canada 's Minister of External Affairs , concluded , meanwhile , a round of <unk> here on future tactics in the conference .	340.390571559469
 The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week .	563.9948520709885
 Princess <unk> , Prince Souvanna Phouma 's young daughter , read the <unk> ' statement .	949.7854003341392
 They had a two-hour luncheon together in an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation , she said .	532.8316369677661
 The three <unk> agreed upon a <unk> agenda for their talks , which are to last three days .	263.85471782110267
 The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days .	488.0844426696585
 TO <unk> WITH <unk> The meetings in <unk> , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government .	408.9148551118354
 <unk> of William S Pfaff Jr , 41 , as promotion manager of The <unk> <unk> Company was announced Saturday by John F <unk> , president of the company .	555.5316985173265
 Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned .	6674.17946727909
 The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department .	416.36730224408825
 He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen <unk> school , <unk> High school and <unk> business college .	400.52681522200874
 From June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps .	622.0597551934849

 They <unk> at <unk> Miles <unk> WASHINGTON - <unk> of <unk> seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan 20 .	804.2768331369655
 Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this <unk> as President John F Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the <unk> ceremonies and ride down this historic <unk> route .	2301.6809211958416
 Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint .	418.8255283372902
 But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it .	832.2639141915298
 MANY <unk> Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government 's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments .	914.013235871877
 Of course , <unk> Pennsylvania , the White House , is the most famous address of the free world .	179.17691400761362
 Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about <unk> high .	1033.6607799456567
 Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about <unk> years old .	705.3337367194551
 In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade .	1184.0552377326874
 They were the <unk> and they wanted to vote .	116.66165833860673
 In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time .	306.0103606512121
 <unk> ON SQUARE Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National <unk> building where hundreds of thousands of this country 's most valuable records are kept .	1514.6638306190903
 Also the department of justice building is located where J <unk> Hoover <unk> over the federal bureau of investigation .	687.0210253059249
 Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania , <unk> with lines that are underground .	780.7070787735154
 Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points <unk> Lafayette Square , opposite the White House .	2076.793693164748
 In this historic square are several statutes , but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen Andrew Jackson , hero of the Battle of New Orleans .	514.1845530969913
 Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units .	2485.8317373311993
 About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade .	734.146240772689
 Division one of the parade will be the service <unk> .	194.50612152878736
 Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas , the respective states of the President and of <unk> L B Johnson .	436.8496988938008
 Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union .	214.26122190924002
 Division three will be headed by the <unk> followed by 12 states ; division four will be headed by the Navy , followed by 11 states ; division five , by the Air Force followed by 11 states .	844.7561573682826

 <unk> , <unk> - What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi ?	829.3800794608993
 Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state 's immediate political future .	463.28901944438104
 This is largely because of the <unk> of the man who operates the <unk> of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million <unk> Gov Ross Barnett .	283.05841776001813
 Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well .	936.627766360612
 Consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year .	926.7269176650818
 <unk> BE <unk> Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .	976.5940492425323
 The <unk> <unk> of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of <unk> and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his <unk> quest for the governor 's office .	309.56822210837163
 There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a <unk> .	641.3162643400136
 Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a <unk> of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the 1960 legislative session .	768.6384864876687
 If Barnett does n't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session .	343.9523879418569
 The odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year .	433.38525347915345
 <unk> ISSUE <unk> always get restless for a special session whether for the <unk> or the <unk> per <unk> is not certain and if they start <unk> .	234.95438395410375
 Barnett is not expected to be able to <unk> the pressure .	136.5887756709071
 The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state 's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .	668.7730867477253
 With eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E Smith as the one most likely to go , the <unk> battle will put to a test the <unk> power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature .	542.70125104689
 Mississippi 's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House .	428.15053817208843
 <unk> badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party <unk> and <unk> , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a <unk> .	526.3893718609033
 And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together .	321.84472021333295
 FUTURE <unk> Barnett , as the <unk> head of the Democratic party , apparently must make the move to <unk> relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the <unk> ranks to completely <unk> him as a party <unk> .	236.48549344273115
 With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election .	784.6879097931164
 Now , the picture is <unk> , and even US <unk> James O <unk> and John C <unk> , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status .	249.65197344016656
 Reports are that it is more than probability that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen .	758.7995240693367
 <unk> <unk> , <unk> - The Gov <unk> H Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor 's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses .	544.0785073340833
 The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue .	713.1020504979059
 But it might give way shortly to another <unk> <unk> that of finances in state government .	387.6988118501815
 The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent .	619.9365287615553
 The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program .	479.56059145192575
 But the <unk> of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation .	470.73571520018925
 <unk> <unk> Indeed , the administration 's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat .	309.3861071680698
 The administration could not say why 28 million was needed for a <unk> program .	322.63546865156496
 The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the <unk> revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can <unk> the required two-thirds vote .	517.1243449508792
 The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature <unk> .	379.11406215563943
 Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to <unk> .	420.0237713507386
 If it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration .	297.6420351769182
 He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature .	441.2643457854728
 Actually , Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway .	707.6176267720231
 Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the <unk> losing battle to block token integration .	1807.7522731257125
 This is not the sort of thing most <unk> would care to acknowledge publicly .	281.5420616101647
 They would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be <unk> .	260.411128279488
 <unk> <unk> <unk> of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition .	300.9195901562381
 He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle .	310.2841223067957
 Then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the 28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period .	700.5307673393487
 It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that 28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one .	250.98150622374786
 But if the administration should find it does not need the 28 million for a <unk> program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes .	329.8444209050786
 This would be in perfect <unk> with the underlying concern in the <unk> the shortage of cash .	164.0434142344516
 It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .	443.2480779695317
 If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma .	635.8406399362149
 Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or <unk> its estimates of anticipated revenues .	705.8242345660149
 <unk> PROBLEM In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another <unk> at raising additional revenues through a tax <unk> .	471.8942491864522
 The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor .	631.4245268191075
 It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem .	245.8200565033204
 But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature .	606.2382642299193
 This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the <unk> to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more <unk> to a tax proposal later in the year .	212.0442713346446
 A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to <unk> .	445.823938881501
 Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations <unk> to profit themselves .	1380.3926397591151
 The new year might see some <unk> , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms .	587.5588743611142

 This year , coach Royal told me if I 'd work on my <unk> he thought he could use me , said Moritz .	607.427970319891
 So I started practicing on it in spring training .	785.0131098614106

 One was on a <unk> screen pass from the <unk> 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon 's territory .	448.3004158825468
 As soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it , Meek said .	501.891865894158
 He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy halfback Terry <unk> had time to turn around .	685.0052892683085
 He really <unk> him h he nailed it for a yard loss .	258.4085845872938
 The Air Force 's , and the game 's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob <unk> which Gannon <unk> on his own <unk> and returned 22 yards .	547.5890132440718
 He just lay back there and waited for it , Meek said .	346.8174794912593
 He almost brought it back all the way .	198.2455053637795
 Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and <unk> Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice .	3954.359289515553
 Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game , Meek said .	902.4830902002018
 He 'll be out of action all this week .	239.32246909677397
 He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game .	301.6897018753033
 There is definitely some <unk> damage in his knee .	343.3191314978428
 Rice has not played since <unk> a knee in the opener with Maryland .	705.0367334838127
 He 's looking a lot better , and he 's able to run , Meek explained .	305.24313017500367
 We 'll let him do a lot of running this week , but I do n't know if he 'll be able to play .	270.1200188632203

 The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League <unk> a <unk> triumph over the Denver <unk> but their visit will be a short one .	796.9633783477174
 The Texans have two more road <unk> at Buffalo and <unk> before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank Stram 's men will meet the <unk> just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in <unk> <unk> .	374.04570479406607
 Buffalo coach <unk> Ramsey , who has become one of the game 's greatest collectors of <unk> , apparently now has found a productive pair in two <unk> Football <unk> , M C Reynolds and Warren <unk> .	547.6812931774502
 <unk> , the former Louisiana State field general , came off the bench for his debut with the <unk> Sunday and directed his new team to a <unk> upset victory over the Houston <unk> , defending league champions .	521.5782308554344
 Just our luck !	2260.4471632419045
 exclaimed Stram .	6516.705990329739
 <unk> would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way .	861.3588879656805
 Ramsey has a thing or two to <unk> about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous <unk> without the <unk> of a top star , Jack <unk> , though he did the team 's <unk> while nursing a knee injury .	387.6698672010777
 Our interior line and out <unk> played exceptionally well , said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game .	1063.220283823183
 In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job .	605.463405824872
 The Texans won the game through ball control , with <unk> Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes .	1871.224333166586
 We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack , explained Stram .	751.5733828326427
 They can be going along , doing little damage , then <unk> , <unk> they can hit a couple of passes on you for <unk> and put you in trouble .	250.45555334585427
 The <unk> did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off .	319.36741355518006
 The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> halfback .	197.52670897334983
 He was called upon 26 <unk> more than all of the other <unk> <unk> and delivered <unk> yards .	176.23895238465076
 The Texans made themselves a <unk> break on the opening <unk> when Denver 's Al <unk> was <unk> loose from the ball when Dave <unk> , the <unk> halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas .	560.3854598441952
 A quick touchdown resulted .	1679.749011147523
 That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away , said Stram , <unk> , I think I 'll put that play in the book .	389.33376994524303

 Jensen got only six hits in 46 <unk> for a <unk> batting average in the first 12 games .	859.3715381248586

 You 'll probably get a ball bat on the head .	465.05832723196403
 He 's mad at the world .	96.3592807747844
 But Jackie had gone into the station .	303.8025115642567
 Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand .	450.62628258730297
 I told him who I was and he was quite cold .	230.9570532847872
 But he warmed up after a while .	311.96768184860554
 I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a <unk> and said anything he Liston got was through a <unk> .	372.518601185428
 He said he had never talked to Liston .	300.7223394423011
 Liston is Bill Liston , baseball writer for the Boston <unk> , who quoted Jensen as saying I ca n't hit anymore .	1829.5395662000114

 <unk> WHEN IT <unk> baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up <unk> <unk> to start millions of <unk> to <unk> .	403.6122117425538
 And so it was over the weekend what with <unk> Warren Spahn pitching his <unk> masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants ' Willie Mays <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> Sunday .	504.34126148776903
 Both , of course , were remarkable <unk> and further <unk> the fact that baseball <unk> is the national pastime .	223.90628958122292
 Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's <unk> pitching probably reached the most hearts .	1061.6053273897423
 It was a real <unk> to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the <unk> milestone .	227.69628853577282
 And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , <unk> I was 40 , and a <unk> big <unk> .	226.01274887305348
 THE <unk> AND <unk> Spahn waved off his new <unk> as one of those good days .	378.46810382470466
 But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the <unk> great <unk> in the game 's history .	282.7963396911371
 Yes , with Bob Grove , Carl <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Art <unk> , Vernon <unk> , et al .	278.8290371434614
 Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a <unk> fine fellow , a ball player 's ball player , as they say in the trade .	594.1887189714607
 I remember his <unk> performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of <unk> .	624.9781431300581
 <unk> DOES N'T <unk> how to merely go through the motions , remarked <unk> <unk> , another all-out guy , who played <unk> that day and <unk> one over the clubhouse .	403.8122823507259

 The record books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace .	443.3591113854067

 The Giants who had been <unk> with the bat in their <unk> <unk> Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park .	302.14243290004515
 It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump .	1752.1250787582835
 THE <unk> TV audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob <unk> that the games are not to be <unk> out when his Bears are playing at home .	593.2892204424962
 This rule providing for a <unk> of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game 's top rulers .	760.0576969116372
 The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the Living Room <unk> Club when games were cut off .	801.700427521461
 Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy .	480.64639449351586
 This year , I am told , the <unk> network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here .	360.5587303325635
 There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .	698.4138459699931
 It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level .	801.9246954209337
 You would be surprised how many fans <unk> stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy .	1356.4694877504717
